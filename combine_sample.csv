                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY: Severe abdominal pain, hypotension.  Please assess the aorta with a
 non-contrast scan.

 TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained through
 the abdomen and pelvis, without the administration of IV or oral contrast, as
 per the request of the emergency room attending physician caring for the
 patient.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are incompletely imaged coronary
 artery calcifications.  There is dependent atelectasis within the visualized
 portions of the lung bases.  The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and
 right kidney are unremarkable. The gallbladder is distended.  There is an
 approximately 5 cm exophytic simple cyst in the upper pole of the left kidney.
 The left kidney is otherwise unremarkable.  There are diffuse vascular
 calcifications throughout the abdomen. There is diffuse calcification of the
 intra-abdominal aorta and common iliac arteries.  There is no evidence,
 however, of aneurysmal dilatation of the aorta or gross dissection (this is a
 limited assessment for dissection, given the non-contrast nature of this
 examination).  There is no free air, free fluid, or lymphadenopathy within the
 abdomen.  The unopacified loops of large/small bowel are unremarkable. There
 is no evidence of bowel obstruction.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Again noted are diffuse vascular
 calcifications.  A Foley catheter is seen within a collapsed urinary bladder.
 There are multiple sigmoid diverticula without evidence of associated
 inflammatory changes.  The rectum and visualized loops of bowel are
 unremarkable.  There is an enlarged and partially calcified prostate gland.
 There is no free air or free fluid within the pelvis.

 Bone windows demonstrate diffuse degenerative changes of the visualized spine.
 There is a solitary bone island of the right ischium.  The osseous structures
 are otherwise unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. Limited non-contrast examination demonstrates diffuse vascular
 calcifications, but no evidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid.

Neuro: Pt is restless at times with some movements in all extremities but does not follow my commands to squeeze my hand or open his eyes. Pupils are 4MM equal and reactive to light bilaterally. His sedation had been off since the day shift and he was getting more and more restless and coughing and chewing on the ETT constantly. After discussion with team the decision was made to use PRN ativan boluses which have been effective to keep him more comfortable.

Resp: Remains on AC 18, TV 600, FIO2 40% with 8cm peep. Good sats. Stable gas. Suctioned frequently in the beginning of the shift. He has mod amts thick pale yellow secretions via the ETT as well as orally. Lungs are coarse.

Also lido drip shut off and pt bolused with amiodarone 150mg then started on infusion of amio at 1mg/min which should be changed to .5mg/min at 11:15PM. He needs the amiodarone at .5mg/min continuously for 18hrs then they will assess if he can be switched to PO regimen. He has had much less ectopy and no runs of VT since starting the amio drip. He tolerated the bolus well without hypotension. His triponin came back greater than 50 today so he is being treated for acute MI. He was given aspirin one tab via the NGT and started on heparin drip. No bolus was given. Infusion started at 6:30PM so he needs PTT at 12:30PM. The heparin sliding scale is in the orders and drip needs to be adjusted according the scale. His swan numbers show SVR 900. CO 5.4. PCW 18-22.

Pt apparently has had poor quality of life recently with mild alzheimer's dementia, poor circulation, neuropathy, diabetes and spent the major part of his life in bed these days. They are comfortable with their decision for DNR and even question whether we should continue to be as aggressive as we are.

He was given 2mg IV ativan and did well. No further sedation required overnight. Pt MAE. Nods ead to questions. Has good cough and gag. His family say his baseline is pleasant but forgetful. He does reach to pull out the ETT when left untied so he is restained for safety.

Cardiac: BP stable 120-130/60. Pt is on Amiodarone via NGT TID. Tolerating this well. HR 80-95 most of the shift. Has rare to occ. PVC/APC. Swan numbers done Q6hrs as ordered and probably swan will come out today. CVP 7-9, PCW 16-20, CO [**7-15**] and SVR 800-900. He remains on heparin drip which needed to be decreased to 750u/hr at 11PM for PTT 110. Repeat PTT will be sent at 5AM.

Resp: Stable gas on AC 14, TV 500, FIO2 30% with 5cm peep. Plan to put pt on PSV early today and try to extubate him. The team needs to meet with the family and decide on if he wil be reintubated if he fails. He has been suctioned for thick pale yellow to white secretions. Lungs are coarse.

GI: Pt is NPO except for meds. +BS noted. No stool.

GU: UO excellent via foley. Urine is cloudy/sedimented.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Admitted from rehabilitation for
hypotension (systolic blood pressure to the 70s) and
decreased urine output.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 76-year-old
male who had been hospitalized at the [**Hospital1 190**] from [**10-11**] through [**10-19**] of [**2101**]
after undergoing a left femoral-AT bypass graft and was
subsequently discharged to a rehabilitation facility.

On [**2101-10-20**], he presented again to the [**Hospital1 346**] after being found to have a systolic

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is retired and had been living
at home with his wife prior to his admission to the hospital
on [**2101-10-11**]; he had been living at [**Hospital3 1761**] for the day prior to admission.  He is a
social drinker and has a 40-pack-year smoking history;
although, he quit smoking 20 years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical
examination revealed temperature was 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit,
heart rate was 83, blood pressure was 124/42 (following
administration of 3 liters of normal saline), respiratory
was 24, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal
cannula.  His heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  There
were normal first and second heart sounds.  There was a 2/6
systolic ejection murmur, and there were no rubs or gallops.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there were
hypoactive bowel sounds.  He had a palpable bypass graft
pulse, [**Hospital3 17394**] dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis
pulses bilaterally; and his surgical incision was clean, dry,
and intact.  Please note that the above examination was done
by the Vascular Surgery team, which was the team that was
initially planning to admit the patient to the hospital.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial
laboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell
count of 12.7, hematocrit was 30.2, and platelets
were 282,000.  His PT was 13.5, PTT was 30.7, and INR
was 1.3.  His serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136,
potassium was 5.4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, blood
urea nitrogen was 53, creatinine was 3.2, and blood glucose
was 91.  His calcium was 8.2, magnesium was 2.4, and
phosphate was 4.8.  Blood cultures drawn on admission were
pending, but ultimately negative.  A urine culture taken on
admission was initially pending, but ultimately grew out
yeast.  A sputum culture taken on admission was also
initially pending, but ultimately also grew out yeast.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His admission chest x-ray demonstrated
stable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery; no
focal areas of consolidation; overall stable appearance of
the chest compared with a [**2101-10-15**] study.  No
radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or
pneumonia.

His admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm,
nonspecific inferior/lateral T wave changes, low QRS voltages
in the limb leads, and T wave changes in V5 and V6 when
compared with an electrocardiogram dated [**2101-10-12**].

An initial abdominal CT was a limited noncontrast examination
that demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications.  No
evidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid,
incompletely imaged coronary artery calcification, a simple
left renal cyst, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged and
partially calcified prostate gland.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was initially admitted to
the Vascular Intensive Care Unit with hypotension, decreased
urine output, and acute renal failure; most likely secondary
to a presumed gram-negative urosepsis (although there were
never any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis).

While boarding in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the
night of admission, the patient had a sudden
cardiorespiratory arrest.  He was resuscitated with
epinephrine, lidocaine, and direct current cardioversion
times four.  He was also intubate for airway protection.

Following these measures, the patient returned to a sinus
rhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100;
the total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to
the return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes.  He
subsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood
pressure.

An echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a
trivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection
fraction of 20% to 25% in the setting of tachycardia and a
hyperdynamic right ventricle; suggesting elevated right-sided
filling pressures.  Although the definitive etiology of this
arrest remained unknown, the most likely trigger was a
non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, as his troponin values were
elevated to greater than 50 following his arrest.

A repeat echocardiogram done on [**2101-10-21**]
demonstrated mild left atrial dilation, an ejection fraction
of 15% to 20%, resting regional wall motion abnormalities
including inferior, mid, and apical left ventricular
akinesis, depressed right ventricular systolic function, and
moderate mitral regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study
of [**2101-10-20**]; the left ventricular function was
unchanged.  There was moderate mitral regurgitation, and the
right ventricular function appeared worse.

On [**2101-10-21**], the patient was loaded with amiodarone
and was subsequently started on oral amiodarone.  The
following day, he was started on heparin intravenously given
his elevated serum troponin to greater than 50; this
medication was continued for 72 hours.  Given his elevated
troponins and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient
was a candidate for cardiac catheterization.

After discussions between the Medical Intensive Care Unit
team and the patient's family, however, the decision was made
to not pursue further invasive procedures given that the
patient had been made do not resuscitate/do not intubate
following the resuscitation mentioned above, and his family
no longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures.

By [**2101-10-23**], he was off pressors and he was
restarted on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor at low doses.

On the evening of [**2101-10-25**], the patient complained
of substernal chest pain that was relieved by NPG SL and
morphine.  He also had ST segment depressions in V2 and V3
that reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain.
Therefore, the patient was again started on heparin;
although, this was discontinued on [**2101-10-26**] when
the patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac
enzymes.  He again had substernal chest pain on [**2101-10-27**]; although, he had no electrocardiogram changes, and he
again ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac
enzymes.

By hospital day four, the patient began to develop evidence
of congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid
resuscitation, and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun.
By the time of his transfer to the General Medicine Service
on [**2101-10-26**], the patient was still significantly
volume overloaded following his aggressive fluid
resuscitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Therefore,
he was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that
he was having signs and symptoms of right-sided congestive
heart failure.  He achieved adequate diuresis by the time of
his discharge to rehabilitation, as his oxygen saturation was
greater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE/SEPSIS:  The patient was started on
gentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam in addition to the
levofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin he was already
taking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to
admission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram-negative
urosepsis, and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous
fluids.

On [**2101-10-21**], his levofloxacin and metronidazole was
discontinued, and he was started on fluconazole given the
growth of yeast on urine culture.  He was taken off of
gentamicin on hospital day three, and his fluconazole was
discontinued on hospital day five (as per the Infectious
Disease Service).  He was taken off of vancomycin on
[**2101-10-28**], and his piperacillin/tazobactam was
discontinued on [**2101-10-29**].

Despite the presumption of a gram-negative urosepsis
precipitating this admission, the patient did not have any
positive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of
yeast in two urine cultures noted above.  He remained
afebrile both before and after discontinuation of his
antibiotics, and he was found to be Clostridium difficile
negative on [**2101-10-28**].

3.  PULMONARY:  As noted above, the patient was intubated and
he was extubated on [**2101-10-24**].  He subsequently
developed wheezing and mild hypoxia; most likely secondary to
cardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his
aggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was gently diuresed
toward the end of his hospitalization, and by the time of his
he was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 95%
on 2 liters nasal cannula, intermittent ipratropium
nebulizers, and chest physical therapy for clearance of his
respiratory secretions.

4.  RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure
and prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid
resuscitation.  By the time of discharge, his serum
creatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline.

5.  NUTRITION:  The patient was found to be profoundly
malnourished with a serum albumin of 1.8 on admission.  Once
he was extubated and taking orals, he performed poorly on a
modified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin
liquid, ground-solid diet with whole medication tablets,
small bites and sips, upright posture with meals, and
aspiration precautions.  He was also given ProMod shakes with
and between meals for nutritional supplementation of his
heart-healthy/diabetic diet.

6.  VASCULAR:  The patient's operative incisions and foot
ulcers continued to heal throughout this admission.  He was
started on an multivitamin, vitamin C, and zinc for improved
wound healing.

7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused one unit of
packed red blood cells on [**2101-10-27**] to maintain a
hematocrit of greater than 30 given his history of severe
coronary artery disease.  His hematocrit subsequently
remained stable.

Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2191-3-21**] at 13:10
Test: TTE (Complete)
Doppler: Complete pulse and color flow
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: The left atrium is mildly dilated.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the
right atrium and/or right ventricle.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

AORTA: The aortic root is normal in diameter. The ascending aorta is normal in
diameter. The aortic arch is normal in diameter. No 2D echo or Doppler
evidence of coarctation of the distal aortic arch.

AORTIC VALVE: The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations
are seen on the aortic valve.

MITRAL VALVE: The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
There is mild mitral annular calcification. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is
seen.

TRICUSPID VALVE: There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: The pulmonic valve leaflets appear
structurally normal with physiologic pulmonic regurgitation.

PERICARDIUM: There is no pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor subcostal views. The
echocardiographic results were reviewed by telephone with the houseofficer
caring for the patient.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. A catheter is seen in the right
atrium with intermittent herniation through the tricuspid annulus. An
associated vegetation/thrombus cannot be excluded. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

If the clinical suspicion for endocarditis is moderate/high, a TEE is
suggested to better define the right atrial catheter.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and fevers.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47-year-old
female with a history of human immunodeficiency virus (last
CD4 count 42 and a viral load of 65,000), cirrhosis,
diabetes, and hypothyroidism presented with eight days of
fevers to 104, chills, shortness of breath, cough, dyspnea on
exertion, and fatigue.

The patient states she has become progressively dyspneic to
the point where she is short of breath with speaking.  She
has also had night sweats for the past two days and whitish
sputum.  She complains of myalgias.  No recent ill contacts.
[**Name (NI) **] known tuberculosis exposure.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was initially 96% on
room air, with a respiratory rate of 20, and a heart rate of
117.  A chest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial opacities.
She received 3 liters of normal saline, clindamycin, and
primaquine for likely Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  She
spiked a temperature to 102.1 and became progressively
dyspneic with her respiratory rate increasing to 40, and her
oxygen saturations dropping to 89% on room air.  She was
placed on 6 liters by nasal cannula, and an arterial blood
gas showed 7.47/28/74.  The patient was given prednisone and
aztreonam for possible cholangitis.

4.  Diflucan 200 mg twice per day.
5.  Videx 400 mg once per day.
6.  Zantac 150 mg once per day.
7.  Klonopin as needed.
8.  Lantus 6 units subcutaneously in the morning; no
sliding-scale.

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN and SULFA DRUGS (cause a rash).
DAPSONE (causes nausea).

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history was noncontributory.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives at home with her son. She
quit tobacco five years ago.  No alcohol.  No illicit drugs.
No intravenous drug use.  No transfusions.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On admission, the
patient had a temperature of 102.1, her heart rate was 118,
her respiratory rate was 40, her blood pressure was 117/57,
and her oxygen saturation was 89% on room air and 94% on 6
liters.  In general, she was ill and toxic appearing.  She
was unable to speak in complete sentences.  She was
cachectic.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed anicteric.  The mucous membranes were dry.  The
extraocular movements were intact.  No thrush.  The neck was
supple.  There was no jugular venous distention.  Thorax
revealed bilateral basilar rales.  No wheezes.
Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia.  There were
no murmurs.  The abdomen revealed mild diffuse tenderness to
percussion, hepatomegaly 6 cm below the costal margin, no
spleen palpated, positive bowel sounds.  There was no rebound
or guarding.  Extremities revealed no lower extremity edema.
Pulses were 2+.  Neurologic examination revealed cranial
nerves II through XII were intact.  Strength was [**5-18**] in all
extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  The patient had
a white blood cell count of 9.7 (with 89% neutrophils and 7%
lymphocytes), and her hematocrit was 34.2.  Chemistries were
within normal limits with a blood urea nitrogen of 9 and a
creatinine of 0.5.  Her aspartate aminotransferase was 69,
her alanine-aminotransferase was 28, her alkaline phosphatase
was 994, and her total bilirubin was 2.2, and her direct
bilirubin was 1.5.  Her lactate was 2.1.  Urinalysis was
negative for leukocyte esterase or nitrites.  It was positive
for 30 protein.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed
sinus tachycardia; unchanged from [**2187**].

A chest x-ray revealed bilateral interstitial opacities in
the left mid lung; consistent with Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia or viral pneumonia.

A right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no cholelithiasis.
No gallbladder wall edema.  Common bile duct was 4 mm.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  From the Emergency Room, the patient
was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit secondary
to respiratory distress.  Symptoms consistent with a
respectively alkalosis.  A chest x-ray was consistent with
possible Pneumocystis pneumonia versus a viral pneumonia.

Given her allergies to both sulfa and dapsone, she was
started on empiric Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia coverage
with primaquine and clindamycin.  She was also started on
prednisone given her low oxygen saturations, and given her
low PAO2.

In the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit, she requested noninvasive
positive pressure ventilation.  A bronchoscopy was performed
with 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and positive
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  Acid-fast bacillus smears
were negative.

The patient's respiratory status continued to improve on her
medication regimen.  She was weaned off of the noninvasive
positive pressure ventilation and eventually was able to
saturate 98% on room air.  She was to be continued on
primaquine and clindamycin for a total of a 21-day course of
antibiotics as well as a 21-day steroid taper.

2.  BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures from
admission from [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] grew out
methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ([**4-19**] blood
cultures).  At that time, the patient was started on
vancomycin therapy with quick clearance of her blood
cultures.

A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out
endocarditis, and it did not show any valvular abnormalities;
although, the tricuspid valve was obscured by her
peripherally inserted central catheter line.  The subsequent
surveillance blood cultures from [**3-17**] on were negative,
and the patient was to be continued on vancomycin
intravenously for a 3-week course.  After that time, blood
cultures should be repeated for surveillance.  The patient
remained afebrile during the remainder of her hospital stay.

3.  CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  The patient has Child A class
cirrhosis from a liver biopsy done in [**2190-10-13**].  Her
cirrhosis was thought to be secondary to her highly active
antiretroviral therapy.  She was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**]
in [**2191-4-14**] for a visit.

A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the
patient's alanine-aminotransferase was slightly elevated and
was within normal limits.

4.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ISSUES:  The patient was
restarted on her highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen
on hospital day four.  The patient tolerated these
medications without any problems.  She was also continued on
acyclovir and fluconazole for prophylaxis.  The patient was
to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20066**] in clinic over the next two
weeks.

5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on
original regimen of Lantus without a sliding-scale secondary
to her steroid taper.  Her blood sugars remained elevated
while in house; ranging from the 200s to the 400s.  Her
Lantus was increased to 12 units subcutaneously in the
morning, and her sliding-scale was increased as well with
improved blood sugars.  She was to be discharged on 12 units
of Lantus in the morning with a strict sliding-scale for the
next three days until her prednisone is tapered; at which
time her Lantus will be decreased to 7 units in the morning,
and her sliding-scale will be decreased as well.

6.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her
Levoxyl.

7.  ACCESS ISSUES:  A peripherally inserted central catheter
line was placed on [**2191-3-19**] for intravenous antibiotics.
It was found to be in the right atrium on chest x-ray and was
pulled back 6 cm with a repeat chest x-ray location in the
superior vena cava.  She will need the peripherally inserted
central catheter line for 14 more days as she finishes her
course of intravenous vancomycin.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed
to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] for cirrhosis and with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 20066**] for her human immunodeficiency virus.  She was to

 CHEST, UPRIGHT AP PORTABLE:  Comparison is made to [**2175-5-30**].  The patient has
 been extubated.  The tip of the right internal jugular central venous catheter
 is unchanged, probably residing at the cavoatrial junction or upper right
 atrium, although it is not well assessed because of low lung volumes.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged, allowing for differences in
 technique. There is persistent left lower lobe opacity obscuring the left lung
 base, which could represent either atelectasis or consolidation.  In addition,
 there is a new possible left upper lobe infiltrate, which is vaguely defined.
 There is no evidence of fluid overload or CHF.

 IMPRESSION:  New vague left upper lobe infiltrate, for which a follow-up
 radiograph is recommended to exclude new consolidation.  Otherwise, no
 significant change or evidence of fluid overload.

 INDICATION:  65-year-old woman status post kidney transplant with decreasing
 hematocrit.

 RENAL TRANSPLANT ULTRASOUND:  Anterior to the transplant is a new 7.6 x 3.5 cm
 fluid collection.  The kidney demonstrates normal arterial and venous
 waveforms with resistive indices ranging from 0.77 to 0.84.  There is a
 prominent area in the lateral aspect of the mid pole, which likely represents
 an artifact as normal blood flow is demonstrated to this region.  There is no
 evidence of hydronephrosis or stones.

 IMPRESSION:  Normal arterial and venous color blood flow and waveform with
 normal resistive indices.  7.6 x 3.5 cm fluid collection, likely simple fluid
 anterior to the transplant.  Focal area of heterogeneity within the lateral
 aspect of the mid pole, which demonstrates normal blood flow and may represent
 artifact, however, attention to this area on follow-up scans is recommended to
 document interval change or resolution.

 INDICATION:  Status post renal transplant.  Also, status post right iliac
 artery thrombectomy.  Right lower extremity swelling and pain.

 COMPARISON:  [**2175-6-2**].

 Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 899**] of the right common femoral, superficial
 femoral, and popliteal veins were performed.  A hematoma is again noted within
 the right groin, measuring 2.0 x 2.7 x 3.1 cm in greatest dimensions, and is
 likely not significantly changed from the prior study, though the hematoma was
 not optimally imaged on the prior exam.  There is normal flow within the
 proximal-most right common femoral vein, though within the distal portion of
 the right common femoral vein and throughout the course of the right
 superficial femoral vein, there are internal echoes and expansion of the
 vessel, without flow, consistent with thrombus.  A very small amount of flow
 is seen distally within the right superficial femoral vein, and the right
 popliteal vein is patent and compressible.  Normal flow and waveforms are
 noted within the right common femoral artery.

 As DVT was noted within the right lower extremity, the left lower extremity
 was examined.  There is normal flow, augmentation, compressibility, and
 waveforms within the left common femoral vein, superficial femoral vein, and
 popliteal vein.

 IMPRESSION:  Acute deep venous thrombosis, within the right common femoral and
 superficial femoral veins, that has developed since [**2175-6-2**].  There is a
 right groin hematoma, unchanged.

 The findings were immediately discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6485**], at the conclusion of
 the exam.

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  End stage renal disease, admitted for
transplant surgery.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year-old
woman with end stage renal disease, secondary to malignant
hypertension. She was started on dialysis in [**2174-2-7**].  She currently was on peritoneal dialysis and appears
to be doing well.  She has a history of gastric angiectasia
which she requires endoscopy. She was admitted on [**2175-5-30**] for
a scheduled living donor kidney transplant by her son, who is
the donor.  She does have a donor specific antibody (B-51)
and will have a final T & B cell class match prior to
transplantation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End stage renal disease, secondary to
malignant hypertension on dialysis.  History of anemia
following gastric angiectasia.  She has no known history for
coronary artery disease for diabetes.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, lives with her husband.  She has a
history of a half pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years.
Occasional alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile.  Vital signs
were stable. Blood pressure was 124/58; heart rate 76; weight
160 pounds. Abdomen soft and nontender.  She has a peritoneal
dialysis catheter in the right lower quadrant. She has good
femoral pulses bilaterally. Mild pedal edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2175-5-30**], the patient went to the
operating room for living donor kidney transplant, performed
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and assisting by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please see details
of this surgery in operating room note. Also during her
operating room time, the patient also had a right iliac
artery thrombosis.  It was noted that at the end of the
completion of the procedure, that she had an ischemic
appearing right foot and absence of a right femoral pulse. In
the operation, there was some difficulty with arterial
anastomosis, renal artery to the left iliac artery and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] came to assist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Again, please see
details of that operation in the operative report.

Postoperatively, the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient had an A line, a central line, Foley. She was
placed on a heparin drip to keep PTT between 45 and 50.  The
patient's dressing was clean, dry and intact. The patient had
2 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drains in place.  Good femoral pulse and good
dorsalis pedis pulse.  These pulses were palpable.  The
patient was making good urine output postoperatively.  Renal
was consulted and made recommendations.  Postoperatively, the
patient had a renal ultrasound demonstrating an unremarkable
renal transplant ultrasound with normal size and appearance
of the transplanted kidney and normal arterial wave forms and
resistive disease, ranging from 0.63 to 0.75 throughout.

On postoperative day number one, the patient had another
ultrasound secondary to her hematocrit decreasing and they
wanted to rule out hematoma. The ultrasound demonstrated that
there was no hematoma seen adjacent to the transplanted
kidney. The transplanted kidney is minimally changed from
yesterday which was on [**2175-5-30**] with a small amount of pelvic
ectasis.  Relatively unchanged resistive indices.  The
patient did get multiple transfusions for her low hematocrit.
Her heparin was discontinued on [**2175-6-1**]. The patient received
1/2 cc per cc of replacement and on [**6-1**], Tacrolimus was
started.  On [**2175-6-2**], the patient had some complaint of right
foot numbness. Lower extremity ultrasound was obtained to
rule out deep venous thrombosis and this showed no evidence
of right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.  On [**2175-6-2**],
WBC was 2.9, hematocrit of 35.2. Also on [**6-2**], PT was 13.5,
PTT was 36.7, INR of 1.2.  Sodium that day was 129 and 4.4,
100 BUN, creatinine of 69 and 6.2 with a glucose of 96.

Vascular surgery continued to see the patient.  It was
decided that hematocrit was stable, that heparin could be
continued. The patient was restarted on heparin.  The patient
still complained of right foot numbness but it was about the
same and not worse.  She was continued on all of her
immunosuppressive medications, including Tacrolimus, Valcyte,
Cellcept, Bactrim, Solu-Medrol.  The patient was transitioned
from heparin to Coumadin.  The patient was transferred to the
floor, continued to make excellent urine output.  The patient
had another ultrasound on [**2175-6-6**] because there was blood in
her [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drain and with the decreasing hematocrit.
Ultrasound demonstrated normal arterial and venous color,
blood flow and wave form with normal residual indices.  7.6
by 3.5 cm fluid collection, likely simply fluid, anterior to
the contrast. Focal area of heterogeneity within the lateral
aspect of the mid pole, probably which demonstrates normal
blood flow and may represent artifact; however, attention to
this area on a follow up scan is recommended to document
interval change or resolution.

On [**2175-6-9**], the patient's right lower extremity was swollen.
The patient complained of right hip and thigh pain, pitting
edema of right lower extremity greater than left lower
extremity so an ultrasound was performed which included the
right iliac artery. This demonstrated acute deep venous
thrombosis within the right common femoral and superficial
femoral veins which had developed since [**2175-6-2**]. There
is a right groin hematoma which was unchanged. The patient
continued to be anticoagulated for DVT.  One drain was
eventually removed, continued on [**2175-6-12**] with drain output of
170, afebrile, vital signs stable.  She went home with
services on the following medications:  Valcyte 450 mg q.
day, Bactrim SS 1 tab q. day, Protonix 40 mg q. day, Nystatin
5 ml suspension, 5 ml four times a day, Colace 100 mg twice a
day, Movlapine 10 mg q. day, Percocet 22 tabs q. day,
Lopressor 100 mg twice a day, MMF 500 mg q.o.d. Coumadin 2 mg
q. day.  This should be monitored to keep the INR between 2
and 3. Reglan 10 mg four times a day before meals and at
bedtime.  Tacrolimus 10 mg p.o. twice a day. Potassium sodium
phosphate, one packet q. day and Compazine 10 mg q. 6 hours
prn.  The patient has a follow up appointment with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] for an appointment.  The
patient needs to change dressings on her wound twice a day
located on her groin, place a dry gauze between the wound and
her skin.  No heavy lifting of greater than 10 pounds for the
first 6 weeks after surgery.

DIAGNOSES:  End stage renal disease, status post renal
transplant.
Arterial thrombosis.
Deep venous thrombosis.
Resolving hypertension.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EMERGENCY MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN.

 HISTORY:  Ring-enhancing brain mass with edema seen on CT scan.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2-weighted brain images with gadolinium
 enhancement.

 COMPARISON STUDIES:  None available at this time.

 WET READ REPORT:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2119**] interpreted this study as revealing
 ""bilateral parenchymal masses, suggesting metastatic disease.  The largest
 mass in the right parietal lobe has a complex appearance, at least 5 cm in
 greatest dimension with at least 8 cm greatest dimension of surrounding edema
 and 7 mm leftward midline shift.""  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2119**] is a member of the
 ""Nighthawk"" Radiology group.

 FINDINGS:  The study indeed reveals a large right parietal, irregularly thick
 ring enhancing mass, possibly with some tiny ""daughter"" cystic components
 extending towards the cortical surface.  As mentioned in the wet [**Location (un) 245**],
 there is a substantial area of surrounding edema, with effacement of the right
 atrium and approximately 7 mm leftward subfalcine herniation.  A smaller area
 of edema is seen within the white matter of the left occipital lobe, but I
 cannot delineate any specific area of enhancement associated with it.  A
 third, very well circumscribed 18 x 26 mm area of elevated T2 signal is seen
 contiguous to the left temporal lobe, and it is difficult to determine whether
 the lesion is intra- or extra-axial in locale.  Again, there is no associated
 enhancement and no abnormal susceptibility is noted, either.  On the coronal
 post-contrast images, there is a questionable area of enhancement,
 approximately 3 mm, immediately subjacent to the left temporal lesion- I am
 not certain that the two findings are necessarily related.  The principal
 vascular flow patterns are identified.  There is no overt extracranial
 abnormality noted.

 CONCLUSION:  Large right parietal lobe mass, which may represent either a
 primary or metastatic brain neoplasm.  The additional abnormalities within the
                                                             (Over)

 (Cont)
 left temporal lobe and left occipital lobe, while they may represent extremely
 unusual manifestations of metastatic disease, which would then render the
 right parietal lobe lesion more likely metastatic, could have alternative
 diagnoses, including hemorrhage or a calcified left temporal meningioma as an
 explanation for the left temporal lesion, and either an inflammatory or
 ischemic process to account for the left occipital lesion.  I discussed this
 case this morning with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], it was decided that a non-contrast head CT
 scan would be a helpful followup diagnostic procedure to further characterize
 the left cerebral hemispheric lesions prior to brain biopsy of the right
 parietal lesion.

 TECHNIQUE:  Head CT without and with IV contrast.

 CT HEAD WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a large right parietal lesion
 with ring enhancement and associated large vasogenic edema. Effacement of the
 sulci and right to left midline shift is again noted, and unchanged when
 compared to the prior MRI study. No evidence of calcifications.

 The left temporal lobe lesion previously described on MRI appears hyperdense
 on CT and demonstrates no evidence of enhancement after intravenous contrast
 administration.  No calcifications are noted within this lesion.

 The small left  occipital lesion described on recent MR, is hypodense on CT
 and show no evidence of enhancement. No new lesions are identified.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. Large right parietal intravenous contrast enhancing lesion with associated
 large vasogenic edema. Hyperdense non-enhancing left temporal lobe lesion, not
 typical for hematoma on a recent MRI.
 Differential diagnosis for these lesions include multifocal glioma and
 multiple metastasis. Less likely demyelinating disease.

 STEREOTACTIC CT SCAN

 HISTORY:  Stereotactic biopsy.

 TECHNIQUE:  Intravenously enhanced stereotactic brain imaging was obtained
 with the overlying frame creating some artifacts through several scans.
 Also, the extreme caudal posterior fossa was not included on the present image
 series.

 FINDINGS:  The large right parietal, irregularly ring enhancing mass is again
 seen with the same degree of compression of the right atrium and contralateral
 subfalcine herniation that was observed on the prior day's studies.  The left
 occipital and left temporal lobe lesions, also described, are not any more
 conspicuous on today's study.  The lack of enhancement of the left temporal
 lobe lesion raises the probability that it is an evolving hemorrhage.  No
 other new lesions are seen, within the technical limitations of this study.

 CONCLUSION:  Stereotactic planning scan, as noted above.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2178-4-17**] CT scan of the head, reported by Drs.
 [**Last Name (STitle) 539**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 5493**] as revealing ""unchanged mass effect and edema around
 large right parietal mass, without evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage
 following biopsy.""

 FINDINGS:  Since the prior study, there is now mild linear hyperdensity within
 the basal cisterns that could be subarachnoid hemorrhage, although
 occasionally the tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 505**] can be somewhat denser
 appearing, in the setting of increased intracranial pressure, a finding which
 would mimic the presence of subarachnoid blood.

 No other new intracranial or extracranial abnormalities are discerned.

 CONCLUSION:  Possible small amount of subarachnoid blood or relatively
 stagnant vascular flow, in the face of increased intracranial pressure, as
 noted above.  We spoke with you immediately after the conclusion of the
 study regarding these findings.

 ADDENDUM:  There is a tiny residual gas collection superior to the biopsy
 site, definitely decreased in extent compared to the prior study of [**4-17**].

 HISTORY: 50 year old woman with new brain lesion presenting for assessment of
 possible osseous metastases.

 INTERPRETATION:

 Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and posterior
 projections.  There is no focal tracer abnormality to suggest osseous
 metastases.  Urinary retention of a large amount of tracer despite attempts at
 voiding limit the evaluation of the pelvis.

 The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer
 excretion.

 IMPRESSION: No scintigraphic evidence of osseous metastases. Evaluation of
 pelvis compromised by large amount of urinary tracer retention.

 FINDINGS:  There has been interval biopsy of the large ring enhancing right
 parietal lesion, yielding the diagnosis of GBM.  Overall, the lesion has not
 changed significantly in one week interim.  Also unchanged are an
 approximately 2.5 cm likely intra-axial left temporal lobe lesion, with a 1 cm
 enhancing nodule in its inferior aspect, as well as an area of edema in the
 left occipital lobe, without a discrete enhancing component.  7 mm leftward
 shift of midline structures and the overall mass effect produced by the
 lesions has not changed appreciably.

 IMPRESSION:  3 stable lesions, right parietal one diagnosed as GBM, left
 temporal one with an enhancing nodular component, and left occipital one
 without visible enhancement.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  CT scan of the previous day.

 FINDINGS:  The present examination is degraded by motion artifacts.  Allowing
 for this limitation, there has been slight interval expansion in size of the
 right parietal cavitary lesion.  The extent of surrounding edema and the
 remaining additional lesions, as well as mass effect, are unaltered in extent.
 The other abnormalities described in the previous day's report as well remain
 stable.  No other new extracranial abnormalities are discerned.

 CONCLUSION:  Findings suggest slight interval increase in the size of the
 right parietal cavitary lesion.  We telephoned you with this observation
 immediately after the performance of the study.

 NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN

 HISTORY:  Status post second brain surgical procedure, which Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 686**]
 indicated included craniotomy and tumor debulking. Rule out postoperative
 intracranial hemorrhage.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2178-4-22**], examination reported by me as revealing
 ""slight interval increase in the size of the right parietal cavitary lesion.""

 FINDINGS:  Since the prior study, surgical staples are now present, as well as
 interval performance of a right parietal craniotomy.  Within the soft tissues
 spanning this defect is gas, presumably postoperative in nature.  The cavitary
 lesion now contains some gas and along its superior aspect, and an
 approximately 1-cm hyperdense area, the latter likely representing hemorrhage.
 This constellation of findings, as well as a rather dramatic reduction in size
 of the cavity, presumably reflects interval partial removal of the tumor or at
 least cavitary contents.  The degree of subfalcine herniation is essentially
 unchanged in degree, as is the overall size and configuration of the
 supratentorial ventricular system.  There is no other interval change
 appreciated.

 CONCLUSION:  Post-surgical changes, as noted above.
 Findings were relayed and discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 686**] today, by telephone.

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 50 year old female presents after having fallen in the
bathtub 4 days ago and hitting the back of her head. Since then
she has had a ""massive headache"" which did not resolve with
Tylenol. She states that she has a high threshold for pain and
did not realize how bad it was during the day while at work but
then when she got home at night she noticed it. The patient
noticed ""silvery spects"" in her vision and she had trouble with
some simple tasks like finding the tags on the back of her
clothing in the morning. She reported that she had to check
several times to make sure she did not put her clothes on
backwards. She has had some dizziness, but no nausea or
vomiting.

EMERGENCY MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN.

HISTORY: Ring-enhancing brain mass with edema seen on CT scan.

TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar T1 and T2-weighted brain images with
gadolinium enhancement.

COMPARISON STUDIES: None available at this time.

WET READ REPORT: Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 71796**] interpreted this study as
revealing ""bilateral parenchymal masses, suggesting metastatic
disease. The largest mass in the right parietal lobe has a
complex appearance, at least 5 cm in greatest dimension with at
least 8 cm greatest dimension of surrounding edema and 7 mm
leftward midline shift."" Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 71796**] is a member of the
""Nighthawk"" Radiology group.

FINDINGS: The study indeed reveals a large right parietal,
irregularly thick ring enhancing mass, possibly with some tiny
""daughter"" cystic components extending towards the cortical
surface. As mentioned in the wet [**Location (un) 1131**], there is a substantial
area of surrounding edema, with effacement of the right atrium
and approximately 7 mm leftward subfalcine herniation. A smaller
area of edema is seen within the white matter of the left
occipital lobe, but I cannot delineate any specific area of
enhancement associated with it. A third, very well circumscribed
18 x 26 mm area of elevated T2 signal is seen contiguous to the
left temporal lobe, and it is difficult to determine whether the
lesion is intra- or extra-axial in locale. Again, there is no
associated enhancement and no abnormal susceptibility is noted,
either. On the coronal post-contrast images, there is a
questionable area of enhancement, approximately 3 mm,
immediately subjacent to the left temporal lesion- I am not
certain that the two findings are necessarily related. The
principal vascular flow patterns are identified. There is no
overt extracranial abnormality noted.

CONCLUSION: Large right parietal lobe mass, which may represent
either a primary or metastatic brain neoplasm. The additional
abnormalities within the left temporal lobe and left occipital
lobe, while they may represent extremely unusual manifestations
of metastatic disease, which would then render the right
parietal lobe lesion more likely metastatic, could have
alternative diagnoses, including hemorrhage or a calcified left
temporal meningioma as an explanation for the left temporal
lesion, and either an inflammatory or ischemic process to
account for the left occipital lesion. I discussed this case
this morning with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], it was decided that a non-contrast
head CT scan would be a helpful followup diagnostic procedure to
further characterize the left cerebral hemispheric lesions prior
to brain biopsy of the right parietal lesion.

Date of Birth:   [**2127-2-27**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Cardiac surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 39-year-old woman with
diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and obesity, with a
one to two months of chest burning with exertion. For the
past six months, she has been participating in a new vigorous
exercise program to lose weight. Her symptoms do gradually
resolve with rest, but they have started to occur now with
walking. She does acknowledge that there is associated
nausea, diaphoresis and shortness of breath. Now recently she
started to get symptoms for the past two days while at rest.
She was referred for an outpatient exercise tolerance test,
where she had chest pain and significant EKG changes. She was
referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization today, which
revealed significant left main artery disease. Just prior to
her transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], she did complain of chest pain and
back pain at about 7/10 intensity and a nitroglycerin drip
was started and she received 5 mg of IV Lopressor and 2 mg of
IV Ativan, which did resolve her pain. While she was in the
cath lab, she had an intraaortic balloon pump placed, and now
she is not actively complaining of any pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies any orthopnea, lower extremity
edema, but she does acknowledge that she does have
dysmenorrhea.

PRIOR MEDICAL HISTORY:  She has diabetes mellitus, type 2,
diagnosed in [**2157**]. She has been able to control it with diet
since [**2166-6-22**]; hypertension and obesity; however, she has
lost 40 pounds in the last six months.

SHE HAS AN ALLERGY TO SHELLFISH.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFERS TO [**Hospital1 18**]:  Atenolol 50 mg a day,
lisinopril 10 mg a day, Lipitor 20 mg a day, aspirin 325 mg
once a day, progesterone, nitroglycerin drip, Lopressor,
Ativan.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke. She does not use ethanol
and she does not use cocaine. Her father had a brain tumor.
Her brother did have coronary artery disease and a myocardial
infarction in his late 30s. Her mother has hypertension. She
does have a strong family history for hyperlipidemia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is comfortable appearing,
in no apparent distress. Vital signs: Temperature 99.1, pulse
72, blood pressure 144/87. Pulse oximetry is 98% on room air.
Head and neck: PERRLA. EOMI. Anicteric. Mucous membranes
moist. Neck supple, no lymphadenopathy, no JVD. Cardiac:
Regular rate and rhythm. Lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, but
she is morbidly obese, positive bowel sounds. Her extremities
are warm, no edema. She has got 5/5 strength in all
extremities.

Her laboratories prior to admission from [**Hospital3 1280**] were
white count 7.4, hematocrit of 39.8, platelets 190,000.
Hemoglobin A1c was 7.1. Sodium was 140, potassium 4.1,
chloride 103, bicarbonate 28, BUN 14, creatinine 0.6. Total
cholesterol was 307, triglycerides were 79, and HDL was 50.

[**Last Name (STitle) 54218**], which was at [**Hospital3 1280**] (it was not at
[**Hospital1 18**]), showed diffuse left main and proximal left anterior
descending artery stenosis, 60% to 70%, which was ulcerative;
50% mid LAD stenosis; 50% left circumflex stenosis after OM1;
moderate right coronary artery stenosis; a normal ejection
fraction of 78%; no mitral regurgitation. Note that the right
coronary artery stenosis that I am reported is different than
what was actually reported on the initial catheterization
results from [**Hospital3 1280**]. This was discussed between Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**], and was not actually considered to be
80% as previously reported.

So this was a woman who was considered to have unstable
angina but not actively ischemic. She was put on an
intraaortic balloon pump, followed in the cardiac care unit,
and was ""preoped"" and consented for a CABG on the next day
because of her three-vessel disease. She was made n.p.o.
after midnight and then in the morning she was taken to the
operating room.

On[**Last Name (STitle) 19203**] of [**2167-1-9**], Ms. [**Known lastname 42915**] went to the
operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for bypass surgery.
Please refer to the previously dictated operative note by Dr.
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for the specifics of this surgery. In brief,
three grafts were made. One was a left internal mammary to
the left anterior descending artery and then two saphenous
vein grafts were connected to the OM1 and OM2. She was on
cardiopulmonary bypass for 76 minutes and the aorta was cross
clamped for 53 of those minutes.

She tolerated the surgery well and was transferred to the
intensive care unit on propofol and Neo-Synephrine drips.

Postoperatively, Ms. [**Known lastname 42915**] did extremely well. Her
intraaortic balloon pump and all of her intravenous drips
were discontinued on postoperative day one. On postoperative
day two she was extubated and on postoperative day three she
was transferred to the floor. Ms. [**Known lastname 54219**] major floor issues
were as follows.

Ms. [**Known lastname 42915**] was followed by physical therapy, which cleared
her to go home with home physical therapy to assist with
mobility, strength and endurance. She was also actively
diuresed with Lasix and had her potassium repleted
accordingly. Finally, she was noted to have hyperglycemia
while she resumed her regular diet. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8392**] consultation
was obtained and they recommended metformin 500 mg twice a
day to maintain euglycemia. She would follow her sugar as an
outpatient and report this back in an outpatient followup
appointment.

On [**1-14**] the patient's central line was discontinued.
She was scheduled to leave, but she developed chest pain;
however, this chest pain was considered not to be cardiac, to
be more gastrointestinal in nature, and she had ......... and
an EKG, both of which confirmed a noncardiac source for this
chest pain.

She is, therefore, on [**1-15**], postoperative day six,
being discharged home in good condition with home physical
therapy scheduled.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Obesity.
4.  Hyperlipidemia.
5.  Unstable angina.
6.  Three-vessel coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass grafting, status post intraaortic
balloon pump.
7.  Hypokalemia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Metoprolol 100 mg t.i.d.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.
4.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. for one week.
6.  Potassium chloride 10 mEq p.o. b.i.d. for one week.
7.  Metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.;  follow your blood sugar
levels and follow up with [**Doctor First Name 8392**].
8.  Percocet one to two tablets every four hours as needed
for pain.
9.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. as needed for constipation.

[**Last Name (STitle) 54220**]owup appointments are with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her primary
care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] one to two weeks, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**], her
cardiologist, in two to three weeks, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] from [**Doctor First Name 8392**]
as directed, and Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in one month. She is also
recommended to follow up in [**Hospital1 18**] Wound Care Clinic in one to
two weeks to remove her staples.

If the previously right coronary artery stenosis is a cause
for concern or patient morbidity in the future, this lesion
can certainly be addressed percutaneously with balloon
angiography. She will be followed very closely by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 677**]
as an outpatient, and if this lesion does cause her problems,
this may be addressed.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 11679**] was admitted and underwent surgical closure of her
patent foramen ovale. The operation was performed minimally
invasive and there were no complications. Following the
procedure, she was brought to the CSRU. She initially remained
hypotensive, requiring volume and Neosynephrine. Within 24
hours, she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
difficulty. By postoperative day two, she successfully weaned
from inotropic support. She maintained stable hemodynamics and
transferred to the floor. On telemetry, she remained mostly in a
normal sinus rhythm with brief periods of accelerated junctional
rhythm. She otherwise continued to make clinical improvements
and was cleared for discharge on postoperative day four. She
remained just on Aspirin therapy. Aggrenox was not resumed as
her PFO was surgically repaired. At discharge, her systolic
blood pressures were in the 100's with heart rate of 80-90. Her
room air saturations were 93% and she was ambulating without
difficulty. She had good pain control with Dilaudid and all
wounds were clean, dry and intact.

size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There was a moderate sized pericardial effusion with some
organization. The effusion appears loculated in the posterior and lateral
segments. The effusion was successfully drained. There was no obvious chamber
collapse though the left atrium was not well seen.. The pericardium may be
thickened.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2132-5-4**].


LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity size. Mild global LV
hypokinesis.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Moderate global RV free wall
hypokinesis. Abnormal septal motion/position.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR.
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.

PERICARDIUM: Large pericardial effusion. Sgnificant, accentuated respiratory
variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, c/w impaired ventricular filling.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Echocardiographic results were reviewed by telephone with
the houseofficer caring for the patient. Results were reviewed with the
Cardiology Fellow involved with the patient's care.

Conclusions:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild
global left ventricular hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size is normal
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a large, circumferential
pericardial effusion extending 2.5-3cm inferior and inferolateral to the left
ventricle, ~1.5-2cm lateral to the left ventricle, 1.5cm around the apex, and
<1cm anterior to the right ventricle. Extensive stranding is seen. Right
ventricular diastolic collapse is not seen, but there is abnormal septal
motion with accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve
inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling/elevated
intrapericardial pressure.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-5-4**], the effusion is
larger, prominent stranding and respiratory variation in transmitral Doppler
are now appreciated. Global biventricular hypokinesis is also now present c/w
diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc.)

History of Present Illness:
Pt reports 3-4 weeks ago he noticed an increase of stress at
work and at home at the same time that he was losing weight to
gain better control over his diabetes (40lb in [**5-15**] weeks).  Pt
reports having increasingly frequent panic attacks which he
controlled with Klonopin and occassional Xanax.  He also noticed
decrease in sleep, energy, concentration, interest and
motivation, and an increase in anhedonia over the past [**2-12**]
weeks.
 His psychiatrist began Zoloft which after 3-4 days made him
jittery and this was switched to Celexa which he seems to be
tolerating better, although his neurovegetative sx seem to
worsen.  He denies SI but reports fleeting, ego dystonic
thoughts of hurting his wife, and has not acted on any of these
thoughts.  Pt reports ruminations concerning whether he is
schizophrenic, will have to stay in the hospital forever, or
will be on meds forever.  Pt and wife also report guilt over
allowing two children to develop bad sleeping habits such that
now children and wife sleep in bed and pt sleeps in chair
downstairs.

Brief Hospital Course:
SOMATIC INTERVENTIONS:
The patient was continued on his outpatient medication regimen
of Lexapro, Nortriptyline, Seroquel, Klonopin and Trazodone.  He
was also offerred Ambien at HS as needed.  The patient was
admitted for ECT and was cleared by Medicine and  Anesthesia.
Of note, per ECT consult, the patient's HS and a.m. doses of
Klonopin were held for procudure.  Overnight, prior to transfer,
the DOC was called in response to the patient being agitated and
tremulous reporting ""I'm going to die"".  Fingerstick glucose was
found to be over 300 - in response, the patient was given 10
units NPH and received Ativan 2mg IM with fair effect.  On the
morning of transfer, the patient was again found to be tremulous
and disoriented, repeating that he felt he was going to die.  He
was again given Ativan 2mg IM with minimal effect.  Fingerstick
was checked and found to be 30.  In the process of obtaining
D50, the patient began to demonstrate myoclonic jerking of arms
and legs.  Code was called when the patient became unresponsive.

THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS:
The patient is followed as an outpatient by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10166**] who
referred him to the inpatient unit for stabilization of his
significant depression as well as for evaluation for ECT.  Mr.
[**Known lastname 28257**] admitted to significantly low mood since [**Month (only) 205**], and
endorsed neurovegetative symptoms consistent with an agitated
depression.

EEG
This is a normal EEG in the awake and drowsy states. Note
is incidentally made of a resting tachycardia.


Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 50M with history of hypertension, type II diabetes,
originally admitted to psychiatry for [**Month/Day/Year **], made NPO p MN for [**Month/Day/Year **]
in AM with 1/2 dose of insulin, who was found unresponsive and
in apparent seizure state, who was found to have a blood glucose
of 30.
.
1)Convulsions:
A code was called and the patient was given Ativan 2mg po x1, as
well as an amp of D50, loaded with Dilantin and transferred to
the MICU.  The seizure was attributed to his hypoglycemic state,
although psych thought there was an element of Klonopin
withdrawal and thus continued to give Ativan 0.5mg po q4.  Pt
had frequent BS checks in the MICU and patient recovered from
his initial event without any post-seizure sequelae.  Pt
continued to be monitored and had no further events.  Neurology
was consulted for his ? seizure event and after a negative exam
and negative EEG, concluded that it was all due to hypoglycemia,
and that further Dilantin would not be necessary.
Dilantin was d/ced and patient continued to do well.  He was
eventually transferred to the floor.   All home medications were
continued and patient continued to express interest in his [**Month/Day/Year **]
treatment on Monday, although refused to be transferred back to
[**Hospital1 **] 4.
All home medications although his insulin dose (nph 20 qPM) was
halved (--> NPH 10 qPM) on the floor, and his sugars were
running in the 150s-250s range.
Pt was sent home to return for [**Hospital1 **] on Monday as an outpatient.
Explicit instructions were given to take all medications as
normal the night before, including his Klonopin, and only take
[**1-13**] dose of NPH insulin the night before, NPO p MN, no morning
NPH dose, and to cover his elevated morning sugars with Humalog
at a conservative sliding scale.  Goal sugars 150s-250s.

2) Type 2 DM - follow sugars closely
- Continue normal dose insulin while taking POs, and when NPO p
MN for [**Month/Day (4) **] in AM, pt was instructed to take [**1-13**] NPH dose the
evening before, no NPH in the AM, and to cover with Humalog prn
according to conservative insulin SS to prevent hypoglycemic
episodes.
.
3) Depression:
Pt with a h/o refractory depression that was originally admitted
to the psych service for [**Month/Day (4) **].  Psych consult remained aware as
pt was admitted to the MICU and then called out to the floors.
Recommended continuing his Klonopin 3mg po bid for his anxiety,
and added Ativan 0.5mg po q4 for coverage of his anxiety and
alleviation of ? withdrawal during periods when he is off the
Klonopin.  Continued his home doses of Celexa, Nortriptyline,
Seroquel and trazodone for sleep.
Pt was to be discharged to return on Monday for [**Month/Day (4) **] treatments
as an outpatient.
.
4) F/E/N:
-Diabetic diet, replete lytes prn
.
5) Code: full

                                 FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
 HISTORY:  Dens fracture.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired contiguous [**Year (4 digits) 15951**] images of the cervical spine were
 obtained without IV contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were
 performed.

 COMPARISON: None.

 CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE:  A comminuted fracture involving the base of the
 dens is present which extends along the left aspect of the C2 vertebral body
 and exits through the left foramen transversarium.  There is only minimal
 displacement of the fracture fragments, without impingement upon the spinal
 canal.  Minimal prevertebral soft tissue swelling is seen anterior to the C2
 level.  No other fractures or listhesis is identified within the cervical
 spine.

 Multilevel degenerative changes are seen predominantly involving the upper and
 mid cervical vertebral body levels with loss of vertebral body height and
 intervertebral disc space, osteophyte formation, and endplate irregularities.
 The visualized outline of the thecal sac appears unremarkable. The airway is
 patent throughout.  Visualized lung apices are clear.

 IMPRESSION:  Comminuted fracture through the base of the dens and left C2
 vertebral body, extending to involve the left foramen transversarium.  The
 left vertebral artery can be further evaluated with CTA examination.

 NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: MR [**First Name (Titles) 597**] [**Last Name (Titles) 15951**] fat saturated T1 images, and
 MRA, is the preferred technique to evaluate possible vertebral artery
 dissection. CTA is not an appropriate technique.

 EXAM:  MRI of the brain and MRA of the head.

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  The patient with C2 fracture, needs further evaluation.

 TECHNIQUE:  T1 sagittal and FLAIR, T2 susceptibility [**Age over 90 15951**] images of the brain
 were obtained.  3D time-of-flight MRA of the circle of [**Location (un) **] was acquired.
 Diffusion-weighted images could not be acquired and the examination is limited
 by motion and was terminated at the request of the referring physician.

 FINDINGS, BRAIN MRI:  In absence of diffusion images, acute infarct could not
 be excluded.  Moderate changes of brain atrophy and small vessel disease are
 seen.  There is no mass, midline shift, or hydrocephalus noted.

 IMPRESSION:  Limited study demonstrating moderate changes of small vessel
 disease.

 MRA OF THE HEAD:

 The head MRA is limited for evaluation due to severe motion.

 IMPRESSION:  Limited MRA without diagnostic information.

 THREE VIEWS OF THE LEFT KNEE:

 There is a fracture of the inferior patella transfixed by a cerclage wire. The
 fracture margins appear indistinct and old.

 There is a joint effusion, with an equivocal fat-fluid level. The oblique view
 demonstrates a vertical linear lucency with could represent an more acute non-
 displaced fracture. If the hardware in the patella was not placed in the past
 several weeks or months, then that lucency does indeed represent a new non-
 displaced patellar fracture.  No other acute fracture is identified about the
 knee.

 Old patellar fracture transfixed by cerclage wire.  Probable new nondisplaced
 patellar fracture.

or months, then that lucency does indeed represent a new non-
displaced patellar fracture. No other acute fracture is
identified about the knee.

IMPRESSION:

Old patellar fracture transfixed by cerclage wire. Probable new
nondisplaced patellar fracture.

ADDENDUM [**2108-8-10**] - Please note that the original house officer
dictation did not reflect the presence of the joint effusion or
suspected acute fracture. This change in [**Location (un) 1131**] was discussed
with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 17148**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2819**] on [**2108-8-10**] at 2:45 pm, who confirms that the old
patellar fracture was remote.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to the trauma service. Orthopedic Spine was
immediately consulted because of his cervical spine injuries.
Recommended non-surgical intervention with cervical collar for
2-3 months. Neurosurgery consulted for patient's cervical
fracture as well, recommendations for further radiologic imaging
to evaluate for any vertebral artery dissection and monitoring
neurological status. Vascular surgery consulted for likely
dissection of left ICA, recommendations for ASA for
anticoagulation; no Heparin given history falls; and re imaging
if patient develops signs and symptoms. Geriatrics consulted
given patient's mechanism of injury; delirium identified and
recommendations made re: treating his delirium; Olanzapine
started; bone densitometry while in rehab to screen for
osteoporosis and initiating Calcium with Vit D.  Speech and
Swallow consulted for his dysphagia; bedside swallow study
performed. Recommendations for nectar thick liquids and ground
diet. Physical therapy consulted due to patient's decreased
functional mobility and falls; recommendations for rehab stay
after discharge from hospital. Patient sustained a mechanical
fall during his hospitalization; a head CT scan and films of his
left knee were obtained; no intracranial hemorrhage identified.
Knee films revealed questionable non displaced patellar
fracture, Orthopedics was consulted and recommended a knee
immobilizer and and follow up in 3 weeks.

Date of Birth:   [**2107-6-13**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65 year old female
with a 20 year history of hypertension and a ten year history
of Type 2 diabetes who demonstrated a positive exercise
stress test in [**2183-3-1**] suggestive for possible coronary
artery disease.  The patient received a stress test as part
of a risk stratification workup and at no point demonstrated
any evidence of chest pain.  A subsequent exercise MIBI study
performed [**2183-3-28**] revealed an exercise capacity of
only 2 minutes 15 seconds on the [**Doctor First Name **] protocol.  There was
no chest pain noted on the test and the peak exercise
electrocardiogram showed 1.5 to 2 mm horizontal to upsloping
ST depression in the inferior leads and in V1 and V2.
Imaging studies revealed a large apical to a small anterior
defect that was reversible.  The patient's ejection fraction
was noted to be 56% with normal wall motion.  The patient
subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2183-4-22**] which demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease
and mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.  The patient was
thereafter referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] for surgical
evaluation and was subsequently scheduled for a coronary
artery bypass graft on [**2183-4-28**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2183-4-28**], the patient underwent a
coronary artery bypass graft times three with grafts from the
left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending,
saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery and
saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well.  The patient's pericardium was
left open.  Lines were placed including an arterial line and
a Swan-Ganz catheter ; both atrial and ventricular wires were
placed; tubes placed included in a mediastinal and bilateral
pleural tubes.  The patient was subsequently transferred to
the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit, intubated, for further
evaluation and management.  Shortly after arriving in the
Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit, the patient was easily weaned
and extubated without complication.  On postoperative day #1,
the patient was noted to be stable for transfer to the floor
and was subsequently admitted to the Cardiothoracic Service
under the direction of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**].  The patient's
postoperative course was uneventful and she progressed well
clinically.  On postoperative day #1, the patient's chest
tube and Foley catheter were successfully removed without
complications.  Follow up chest x-ray demonstrated no
evidence of pneumothorax, and the patient was noted to be
independently productive of adequate amounts of urine for the
duration of her stay.  Physical therapy performed an initial
evaluation with the patient and followed her progress for the
duration of her stay.  On postoperative day #3, the patient's
pacer wires were removed without complications and her
sternal incision was noted to be clean, dry and intact with
Steri-Strips in place.  The patient was successfully advanced
to a regular diet, which she tolerated well and was noted to
have adequate pain control via oral pain medications.  The
patient steadily advanced in her ability to ambulate freely
and was subsequently cleared for discharge to home by
physical therapy.  The patient was subsequently cleared for
discharge to home on postoperative day #4, [**2183-5-3**], with
instructions for follow up.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is to be discharged to
home with instructions for follow up.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.12 hours times ten days
2.  Potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. q. 12 hours times ten days
3.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.

8.  Valsartan 160 mg p.o. q.d.
9.  Lopressor 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient is to maintain her
incisions clean and dry at all times.  The patient may shower
but she is to pat dry the incisions afterwards; no bathing or
swimming.  The patient may resume a regular diet.  The
patient has been advised to limited physical activity; no
heavy exertion.  No driving while taking prescription pain
medications.  The patient has been advised to follow up with
her primary care provider within one to two weeks following
discharge.  The patient is to follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**]
within four weeks following discharge; the patient is to call
to schedule an appointment.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed with mid to distal/apical akinesis. The basal segments
contract best. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears
depressed. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
Compared to the prior report dated [**2128-6-21**], systolic dysfunction is new.

IMPRESSION: Severe regional LV systolic dysfunction (?multivessel CAD).

 INDICATION:  Cardiogenic shock, status post pulmonary artery catheter
 placement.

 PORTABLE AP CHEST:  Comparison is made to study performed one day prior.
 Nasogastric tube is coiled within the stomach.  There has been interval
 placement of a right femoral approach Swan-Ganz catheter, which likely
 terminates within the main pulmonary artery trunk.  In addition, intraaortic
 balloon pump is in satisfactory position, approximately 5 cm below the aortic
 arch.  There are low lung volumes, cardiomegaly, and persistent interstitial
 edema.  Dense left retrocardiac density is consistent with atelectasis, but
 underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Termination of Swan-Ganz catheter within the main pulmonary artery.
 2.  No significant interval change in mild pulmonary edema and left lower lobe
 atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.

 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, end stage renal disease, evolving myocardial infarction
 and cardiogenic shock.  Just re-adjusted position of pulmonary catheter
 placement giving right ventricular pressure tracing.

 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the patient in sitting semi-upright position is
 analyzed in direct comparison with a similar preceding study of [**9-14**].
 During the interval, the Swan-Ganz pulmonary catheter approached from below
 has been removed.  On previous examination, bilateral mostly centrally located
 pulmonary densities have regressed some slightly and demonstrate improvement
 of the edema pattern.  No new parenchymal infiltrates are identified.

 The position of the Swan-Ganz catheter tip on the preceding study was just at
 the level of the pulmonary valve.  Consequently the possibility that the
 catheter tip still remaining in the outflow tract of the right ventricle is
 apparent. Secure position of PA catheters could have the distal 2-3 cm at
 least in the proximal portion of the right main stem or the left main stem.

 IMPRESSION:  Removal of Swan-Ganz catheter.  No pneumothorax.  Edema pattern.

 the left mid and lower lung zones with some air bronchograms visualized in the
 left retrocardiac region.  Review of recent radiographs of [**9-16**] and 21,
 [**2133**] demonstrated more extensive opacity suggestive of diffuse pulmonary
 edema.  It is uncertain whether the residual opacity in the left lung reflect
 slowly resolving edema or if there is a superimposed process such as
 infection.

 Bilateral small pleural effusions are noted.

 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
  Evaluate patency, flow of AV graft
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT

 HISTORY:  87-year-old man with hemodialysis graft in the right upper extremity
 with no thrill, difficult access, and bounding pulse.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 168**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16**], Attending Radiologist, present
 and supervising the entire procedure.

 FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE:  The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table
 after appropriate consent was obtained.  The right arm was prepped and draped
 in sterile fashion.  The graft was accessed with a 21-gauge needle after 1%
 lidocaine was used for local anesthesia.  The 0.018 guidewire was advanced
 toward the central venous circulation and the needle was exchanged for a 4.5-
 French introducer sheath.  Venogram performed with and without placement of a
 tourniquet over the axillary vein demonstrated tight venous stenosis
 immediately adjacent to the anastomosis between the graft and the brachial
 vein.  Based on the diagnostic findings, it was decided that the patient was a
 good candidate for and would benefit from angioplasty.  0.035 [**Last Name (un) 180**] wire was
 placed into the sheath and the sheath was exchanged for a 5- French
 angiographic sheath. 6 mm, 2 cm, and 8 mm, 4 cm balloons were used for
 sequential balloon dilatation of the venous stenosis. A followup venogram
 demonstrated substantial improvement in the luminal diameter of the brachial
 veins adjacent to the graft-to-vein anastomosis.

 COMPLICATIONS:  No immediate complications.

 IMPRESSION:  Angiogram of the AV graft in the right arm demonstrated tight
 stenosis of the brachial vein adjacent to the graft-to-vein anastomosis.
 Angioplasty with 6 mm and 8 mm none-cutting balloons was performed with good
 results.

cardiac catheterization with placement of three stents and IABP.
 Swan catheter placement.


History of Present Illness:
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: 87 yo M with chronic kidney disease
s/p AV Graft placement [**8-2**], stroke, hypertension, diabetes, and
peripheral vascular disease presents with chest pain and
shortness of breath. He reports that his chest pain began
approximately one week ago. During the week it has gotten worse.
It is substernal, radiating to left shoulder, especially with
inspiration. It is associated with shortness of breath. He came
to the hospital today because the pain was much worse, [**9-6**]. In
addition, he noted today black stools. He has been taking iron.
He reports lightheadedness. Denies nausea, vomiting,
diaphoresis, arm paresthesias. He has also noticed a cough
recently but has not been able to produce sputum (though he
feels congested).
.
The pt was seen in Geriatric Urgent Care clinic on [**9-11**] for
dyspnea. He noted worsening in the supine position. An CXR at
the time to evaluate possible CHF showed ""No evidence of
congestive heart failure or pneumonia. Elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm"".
.
In the ED, the patient was given 80mg IV lasix x 2 with UOP of
100-200cc. He received nitropaste, lopressor IV and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and
morphine, and was started on a nitro gtt. Heparin was started as
well, and 1 unit PRBCs was transfused. He was given one dose of
protonix, levofloxacin and . BPs were in the 110s-120s/50s-60s,
HR 70s-80s. Renal, GI, and cardiology consults were called. The
patient continued to report [**9-6**] pain, eventually decreased to
[**6-6**] with titration of the nitro gtt. On arrival in the CCU, he
still reported [**6-6**] pain. He was on nitro at 120 mcg/min and
heparin at 850 units/hr.

COMMENTS:
1. Right heart catheterization revealed elevated right and left
sided
pressures. (PCWP = 25 mmhg).
2. Left heart catheterization revealed no evidence of systolic
hypertension.  Calculated cardiac output and index were 5.0/2.8.

3. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
three vessel coronary artery disease.  The left main coronary
artery had
a 40% mid-vessel stenosis.  The left anterior descending artery
had
diffuse proximal disease with serial 70-80% stenosis.  The left
anterior
descending had mild diffuse disease in the mid and distal
segments.  The
large first diagonal had an 80% proximal lesion.  The left
circumflex
coronary artery had mild diffuse disease in the proximal, mid,
and
distal segments.  There was a subtotal occlusion of the OM1.
The right
coronary artery was the dominant vessel.  There was total
occlusion of
the right coronary artery in the proximal segment.  The distal
RCA
filled via collaterals from the LCA septal branches.
4. No left ventriculography was undertaken given elevated Cr.
5. Successful predilation using 2.0 X 12 sprinter balloon and
stenting
using a minivision 2.5 X 23 stent of the proximal OM1 with
lesion
reduction from 99 to 0%
6. Successful predilaton using a 2.0 X 20 Maverick balloon and
stenting
using 3.0 X 30 Driver stent of the proximal LAD with lesion
reduction
from 80% to 0%.
7. Successful predilation using 2.0 X 12 sprinter balloon and
stenting
using a 2.25 X 15 minivision stent of the proximal D1 with
lesion
reduction from 80% to 0%. The final angiogram showed TIMI III
flow in
the vessels intervened with no residual stenoses in any of the
stents.
Thre was no distal embolisation or dissection noted in any
vessel.
8. Successful insertion of IABP via right femoral artery.
( see PTCA comments for the above procdures from 5 through to 8)

9. At the request of the renal consultants, a 12 French Dialysis
central
venous catheter was placed using the Seldinger technique in the
left
common femoral vein.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated right and left sided pressures.
3. Preserved cardiac output/cardiac index.
4. Successful stenting of the OM, LAD and D1.
5. Successful insertion of IABP via right femoral artery.
6. Successful implantation of a central venous dialysis catheter
in the
left femoral vein.

         REQUESTED BY DR. [**Last Name (STitle) 9974**] ON [**2134-9-21**]..


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Rhythm: pt had 2 episodes of monomorphic VT accompanied by
fall in BP, LOC, terminated x 1 via precordial thumb.
Electrolytes were repeleted, pt was bolused with Amiodarone x 2,
and started on an Amio gtt. Amiodarone was then changed to po,
with a dosing schedule of 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] for one week, followed by
400 mg daily for one week, then 200 mg per day.  Monomorphic VT
thought to be likely due to a fixed area of scarring from
previous MI.  Placement of an ICD was discussed.  However, given
the pt's poor prognosis for non sudden cardiac death reasons,
and given his increased infectious risk, it was decided to treat
his arrhythmia medically.  Of note, the QT interval was
prolonged (506), likely secondary to amiodarone.  Patient
remained in sinus rhythm on Amiodarone.
2. CAD: Pt with NSTEMI. Cath on [**9-12**] showed 3 vessel disease,
subsequently underwent successful stenting of OM, D1, LAD and
IABP placement. IABP was discontinued after the patient was able
to maintain his own pressure.
Echo completed on [**9-13**], which showed apical akinesis, with
severely depressed systolic function.  Patient was initially
started on heparin and bridged to Coumadin, however, he had
another episode of guaiac positive stool, and given his history
of melena and coffee ground emesis, the risk for GI bleed was
thought to be high and anticoagulation was discontinued.
The patient was continued on an aspirin, Statin, beta blocker,
and was started on an ACE, all of which he will continue as an
outpatient.  His swan and sheath were discontinued without
complications.
3.PUMP: CHF: EF 20% by ECHO
He was initially placed on Imdur/Hydral for afterload reduction
and an ACE was initially avoided in an attempt to salvage his
kidneys.  However, he was eventually started on low-dose
lisinopril to be titrated up if necessary.  Patient also
underwent hemodialysis on Mon/Wed/Fri schedule.
4. Renal: Chronic renal disease, secondary to hypertensive
nephrosclerosis, is status post graft placement with mature A-V
graft. Quentin catheter initially used, then discontinued once
graft accessible.  On [**9-22**], graft noted to be difficult to
access per renal, patient underwent AV fistulogram, and
successful angioplasty was performed.
5. ID: Patient completed a seven day course of levofloxacin for
suspected pneumonia, white blood count noted to be persistently
elevated.  Patient was pan cultured, and a urine culture was
positive for yeast.  Foley catheter was discontinued and a
repeat culture was sent, also positive for [**Female First Name (un) **].  Patient
started on a 2 week course of Fluconazole.  Blood cultures
pending at time of discharge, no growth to date.
6. Heme: anemia, likely anemia of chronic disease from chronic
renal disease.  Patient also had an episode of melena and coffee
ground emesis, guaiac positive stool.  Hematocrit was followed,
and patient was transfused as necessary to keep hematocrit above
30.  Patient will need GI workup as an outpatient. Oral iron
supplementation was discontinued as patient receiving Fe in
addition to EPO and Procrit at hemodialysis
7. DM: Patient was started on glargine for persistent
hyperglycemia and covered with a regular insulin sliding scale
with Accu-Check to monitor.
8. Psych: Patient was continued on his home dose of Zoloft 100
mg once daily.
Patient tolerated a low Na/cardiac healthy diet and was placed
on a PPI for GI prophylaxis.
Patient was discharged to rehab facility with plan to follow up
with cardiology and PCP within the next month.

ventilated on IMV pressure support with a rate of 14,
pressure support of 10, PEEP of 7.5, volume of 500, and 40%
FIO2.  On general examination, the patient was a very
ill-appearing female, in no apparent distress.  She was
intubated.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination
revealed 1 to 2 mm nonreactive pupils.  Neck examination
revealed no jugular venous distention and no bruits.  Cardiac
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and
S2, and no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Pulmonary examination
revealed that the lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdominal examination revealed a belly that was
soft, nontender, nondistended, with normal bowel sounds.
Extremity examination revealed no edema, with 2+ dorsalis
pedis pulses bilaterally.  Neurological examination revealed
a patient that was moving all four extremities, opening eyes
intermittently, withdrawing to pain.  The patient had 2+ deep
tendon reflexes, and downgoing plantar reflexes.

LABORATORY DATA:   The patient had a white blood cell count
of 5.1, hematocrit of 35.9, platelets of 259.  The patient
had a sodium of 140, potassium of 4.4, chloride of 103,

toxicology was negative.  Urinalysis revealed negative
nitrates, leukocytes, blood, no red blood cells, no white
blood cells, occasional bacteria, and less than one
epithelial cell.

Head CT:  No signs of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient is a 64-year-old female with a
history of hypertension and depression with suicidal ideation
and previous history of overdose attempt, status post likely
overdose on Ambien and Zyprexa, status post intubation and
hemodynamically stable.

1.  Toxicology:  Patient with likely Ambien overdose and
Zyprexa overdose.  Her symptoms of light coma, somnolence and
respiratory compromise were consistent with Ambien overdose.
The patient also had evidence of myosis, which was consistent
with Zyprexa overdose.  The patient had been gastric lavaged,
charcoaled and supported in the Emergency Department.  In the
Intensive Care Unit, the patient was supported with
intravenous fluids and gradually weaned on the ventilator to
the point where she was successfully extubated shortly after
arriving to the Intensive Care Unit.

2.  Psychiatric:  Patient with major depression, recently
exacerbated by the loss of her husband, now with a second
overdose attempt in her lifetime.  Likely Zyprexa and Ambien
were the agents responsible.  Multiple attempts were made in
the effort to contact the patient's outpatient psychiatrist,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She was unable to be reached.  Psychiatry was
consulted, who felt that the patient needed inpatient
evaluation and treatment.  They also recommended
psychotropics be avoided, and that the patient have a
one-to-one sitter.  Social Work and Case Management were
consulted.

3.  Cardiovascular:  Patient was hemodynamically stable with
history of hypertension.  Her antihypertensives were held.
Her electrocardiogram was unremarkable, although there were
no studies for comparison.

4.  Pulmonary:  Patient intubated secondary to decreased
mental status without a primary lung process.
Post-extubation arterial blood gas did not suggest any
obstructive lung process leading to hypercarbia or hypoxemia
from other pulmonary process.  The examination was
unremarkable.  A facile extubation was anticipated, and the
patient was extubated within several hours of arriving in the
Intensive Care Unit.

5.  Psychosocial:  Communication was maintained with the
patient's daughters, who also felt that the patient should
receive inpatient evaluation and treatment.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to an inpatient
psychiatric bed.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:   Zestril 20 mg by mouth once daily,
Estradiol 1 mg by mouth once daily.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Major depression
2.  Ambien and Zyprexa overdose
3.  Hypertension

 INDICATION:  Question of retained vascular catheter.

 COMPARISON:  [**2196-4-9**] - 10:41.

 FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior study the previously identified radiopaque
 density in the  the left subclavian region is no longer identified and
 presumably this was an artifact or  outside the patient.  Since the previous
 exam the patient has been extubated.

 The lungs are clear without evidence for focal consolidation, or fluid
 overload.  Heart size is normal.

 IMPRESSION:

 Normal chest.  The concern of the previous radiopaque catheter is dismissed as
 it is no longer present.

History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 year old male with known CAD. He underwent PTCA to
LAD and diagonal in [**2145**]. Prior to hernia repair operation, an
ETT in [**2153-7-27**] was notable for EKG changes. An ECHO in [**Month (only) 205**]
[**2153**] was notable for mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1192**] AS. The [**Location (un) 109**] was
estimated at 1.1 cm2 with peak/mean gradients of 34 and 22 mmHg.
The was mild concentric LVH with an LVEF of 60%. He was
subsequently referred for cardiac catheterization. This was
performed at the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2153-8-16**]. Angiography showed a right
dominant system with 80% ostial LAD lesion; first diagonal had a
60% stenosis; the circumflex had a 60% lesion while the RCA had
a 40% stenosis. There was only mild AS with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 1.8 cm2
and mean gradient of 18mmHg. Left ventriculogram showed
preserved LV function. Based on the above results, he was
referred for CABG.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted and underwent four vessel CABG on [**2153-9-3**] by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Surgery was uneventful - see op note for further
details. Following the operation, he was brought to the CSRU in
stable condition. There he was weaned from inotropic support and
was extubated without difficulty. He was noted to have some
ventricular ectopy which improved after intravenous Lidocaine
and PO beta blockade. K and Mg levels were monitored closely and
repleted per protocol. He otherwise maintained stable
hemodynamics. Units of PRBCs were intermittently transfused to
maintain hematocrit close to 30%. On POD 1, he transferred to
the SDU.  He remained in a normal sinus - no further ventricular
ectopy was noted. Beta blockade was slowly advanced as
tolerated. Over several days, he made clinical improvements. By
discharge, he was near his preoperative weight with oxygen
saturations over 96% on room air. He also worked daily with
physical therapy and made steady progress. His hospital course
was otherwise uneventful and he was cleared for discharge to
home on POD 5. He is scheduled to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
his local cardiologist in approximately 4 weeks.

 MR BRAIN WITH CONTRAST:

 COMPARISON:  None.

 HISTORY:  Preoperative planning for left parasagittal meningioma.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar post-contrast imaging of the brain was performed.

 FINDINGS:  Limited post-contrast MRI of the brain demonstrates an enhancing
 left parafalcine lesion measuring approximately 2.1 x 3.3 x 3.5 cm.  This
 lesion is in close proximity to the adjacent sagittal sinus although it does
 not appear to be involving the sinus.  No other abnormal enhancing lesions are
 identified.  There is minimal surrounding edema and no significant mass
 effect.

 IMPRESSION:  Dural-based enhancing lesion arising from the left parafalcine
 region with minimal mass effect and small amount of surrounding edema.  This
 likely represents a meningioma.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EXAM:  MRI of the brain.

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with brain tumor status post resection.

 TECHNIQUE:  T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion
 axial images of the brain were obtained before gadolinium.  T1 axial and MP-
 RAGE sagittal images acquired following gadolinium.  Comparison was made with
 the MRI of [**2157-10-20**].

 FINDINGS:  Since the previous study, the patient has undergone resection of
 left parietal parafalcine extra-axial mass.  Blood products are seen in the
 region with edema.  Air is seen intracranially.  Bilateral small subdural
 collections are seen.  These findings are indicative of post-operative change.
 No acute infarct seen.  No midline shift or hydrocephalus identified.  No
 residual nodular enhancement is identified.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Status post resection of left parietal parafalcine mass with expected
 post-surgical changes of blood products and air in the region and intracranial
 air and bilateral small subdural collections.  No acute infarct, mass effect,
 or hydrocephalus.  No residual nodular enhancement seen.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 18661**] is a 75yo RHM with CAD s/p CABG, AS, HTN,
Hyperlipidemia, now here for resection of parasagittal
meningioma. Pt first noted symptoms three years ago with
dizziness, was evaluated in [**State 108**] where a head CT revealed L
frontal extraxial mass (~2cm per pt). Seen by a neurosurgeon in
[**State 108**] and told watchful waiting was best. However 6 weeks ago
the patient had an episode where his right lower extremity ""gave
way."" Occasionally ""feels like wood."" He underwent MRI scan
which revealed enlargement of the mass, with descriptions from
records documenting 2.5x3.4x2cm L frontal lobe extraaxial mass,
and also
a much smaller 12mmx8mmx4mm mass in the R temporal lobe (per
[**Hospital3 417**] report). He was started on decadron 1mg [**Hospital1 **].
Pt was scheduled for resection with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**2157-10-22**].
However last night he was moving furniture, and upon moving a
bureau back into his home he developed a sensation of numbness
at his foot that travelled to his upper thigh over the course of
only a few seconds. He then noted rhythmic low amplitude shaking
of the limb that was not suppressable. His right arm then
extended outwards beyond his volitional control. His wife took
him to [**Hospital3 417**] where he was given ativan IV, loaded with
Fosphenytoin 1,000mg IV. The movements subsided in about 15
minutes. No loss of consciousness. No speech/language deficits.
No visual loss. He reports no further episodes since. Currently
feeling well. Denies any headaches. He does still feel a loss of
sensation in a stocking distribution of his right foot to his
ankle. When he walks he feels like he does not have command over
his right leg. No bowel or bladder dysfunction.

IMAGING:
-------------------
MRI Head [**10-20**]:
FINDINGS: Limited post-contrast MRI of the brain demonstrates an
enhancing
left parafalcine lesion measuring approximately 2.1 x 3.3 x 3.5
cm. This
lesion is in close proximity to the adjacent sagittal sinus
although it does not appear to be involving the sinus. No other
abnormal enhancing lesions are identified. There is minimal
surrounding edema and no significant mass effect.
IMPRESSION: Dural-based enhancing lesion arising from the left
parafalcine
region with minimal mass effect and small amount of surrounding
edema. This
likely represents a meningioma.

MRI Head [**10-22**](post-op):
FINDINGS: Since the previous study, the patient has undergone
resection of
left parietal parafalcine extra-axial mass. Blood products are
seen in the
region with edema. Air is seen intracranially. Bilateral small
subdural
collections are seen. These findings are indicative of
post-operative change.No acute infarct seen. No midline shift or
hydrocephalus identified. No residual nodular enhancement is
identified.
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post resection of left parietal parafalcine mass with
expected
post-surgical changes of blood products and air in the region
and intracranial air and bilateral small subdural collections.
No acute infarct, mass effect, or hydrocephalus. No residual
nodular enhancement seen.

EEG [**10-20**]:
BACKGROUND: A 9 Hz posterior predominant rhythm was seen in the
brief
waking state.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Produced no activation of the
record.
SLEEP: The patient progressed from wakefulness to drowsiness but
did
not attain stage II sleep.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an
average rate
of 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is a normal predominantly drowsy routine EEG in
the
waking and drowsy states. There were no focal lateralize or
epileptiform features.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the Neurosurgical service on [**10-18**]
following an episode of seizure.  The patient underwent
resection of the left para-sagittal mass on [**10-21**].  He tolerated
this procedure well and remained neurologically unchanged
post-resection.  He was taken to the ICU post-operatively for
close monitoring on POD0.  On POD#1, he was transferred to the
neurosurgical floor. He was subsequently seen and evaluated by
PT and OT and was cleared for discharge home.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
WOUND CARE:
??????	You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and
report any of the following problems to your physician.
??????	Keep your incision clean and dry, you may shower from the neck
down. You will not need to have sutures removed, as Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] has
used dissolvable sutures.
??????	Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your
incision.
??????	DO NOT DRIVE until you are seen at the first follow up
appointment.
??????	Do not lift objects over 10 pounds until approved by your
physician.

DIET
Usually no special diet is prescribed after a craniotomy. A
normal well balanced diet is recommended for recovery, and you
should resume any specially prescribed diet you were eating
before your surgery.  Be sure however, to remain well hydrated,
and increase your consumption of fiber, as pain medications may
cause constipation.

MEDICATIONS:
??????	Take all of your medications as ordered.  You do not have to
take pain medication unless it is needed.  It is important that
you are able to cough, breathe deeply, and is comfortable enough
to walk.
??????	Do not use alcohol while taking pain medication.
??????	Medications that may be prescribed include:
-Narcotic pain medication such as Dilaudid (hydromorphone).
	-An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or
Docusate). If you become constipated, try products such as
Dulcolax, Milk of Magnesia, first, and then Magnesium Citrate or
Fleets enema if needed). Often times, pain medication and
anesthesia can cause constipation.
??????	You have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam), you will
not require blood work monitoring.
??????	You were on Aspirin, prior to your surgery. You may restart
this one week after your surgery.
??????	Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any
anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and
Ibuprofen etc, as this can increase your chances of bleeding.
??????	You are being sent home on steroid medication taper, make sure
you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec,
Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach
irritation.  Make sure to take your steroid medication with
meals, or a glass of milk.

ACTIVITY:
The first few weeks after you are discharged you may feel tired
or fatigued. This is normal. You should become a little stronger
every day. Activity is the most important measure you can take
to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself
again. In general:
??????	Follow the activity instructions given to you by your doctor
and therapist.
??????	Increase your activity slowly; do not do too much because you
are feeling good.
??????	You may resume sexual activity as your tolerance allows.
??????	If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing
activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and
begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
??????	DO NOT DRIVE until you speak with your physician.
??????	Do not lift objects over 10 pounds until approved by your
physician.
??????	Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and
push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy
objects, or straining at stool.
??????	Do your breathing exercises every two hours.
??????	Use your incentive spirometer 10 times every hour, that you
are awake.

WHEN TO CALL YOUR SURGEON:
With any surgery there are risks of complications. Although your
surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these
complications developing. These complications include:
infection, blood clots, or neurological changes. Call your
Physician Immediately if you Experience:

??????	Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory
loss, or difficulty speaking.
??????	Double, or blurred vision. Loss of vision, either partial or
total.
??????	Hallucinations
??????	Numbness, tingling, or weakness in your extremities or face.
??????	Stiff neck, and/or a fever of 101.5F or more.
??????	Severe sensitivity to light. (Photophobia)
??????	Severe headache or change in headache.
??????	Seizure
??????	Problems controlling your bowels or bladder.
??????	Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
??????	Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.

Call 911 or go to the Nearest Emergency Room if you Experience:
??????	Sudden difficulty in breathing.
??????	New onset of seizure or change in seizure, or seizure from
which you wake up confused.
??????	A seizure that lasts more than 5 minutes.

Important Instructions Regarding Emergencies and After-Hour
Calls
??????	If you have what you feel is a true emergency at any time,
please present immediately to your local emergency room, where a
doctor there will evaluate you and contact us if needed. Due to
the complexity of neurosurgical procedures and treatment of
neurosurgical problems, effective advice regarding emergency
situations cannot be given over the telephone.
??????	Should you have a situation which is not life-threatening, but
you feel needs addressing before normal office hours or on the
weekend, please present to the local emergency room, where the
physician there will evaluate you and contact us if needed.

Brief Hospital Course:
39 yo male with history of GERD admitted with IMI.
.
IMI - His EKG and cardiac enzymes were consistent with IMI. He
has risk factors that included family history and
hypercholesterolemia and tobacco use. He had a stent placed in
the RCA and was given aggrastat post cath for 18 hours. He was
continued on ASA, started on maximum dose statin, beta blocker
and ACE inhibitor, plavix. He should remain on plavix for at
least 6 months. Echo showed preserved EF. He was also counseled
on smoking cessation and diet/nutrition.
.
Hypercholesterolemia - He was started on  maximum dose statin,
80mg atorvastatin. If his triglycerides remain elevated,
gemfibrozil could be added as an outpatient.

Elevated glucose: He may have glucose intolerance. He was
counseled on a low sugar diet and should have this followed up
by his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 61986**] he can be managed with diet control only.

Transaminitis - He likely has NASH given hypercholesterolemia
and obesity; His
hepatitis serologies were pending at time of discharge. His
LFT's should be followed up in 6 weeks with initiation of statin
therapy.

CAD history althouth cath in '[**41**] reported to be negative with
subsequent negative stress test. Pt has history of vertigo with
recent flare after fall from slipping on ice. Otherwise, pt was
in USOH until 1 day prior to admission when his insulin pump
fell out at 2am. Pt took some short acting insulin, but no
lantus. Pt developed worsening nausea followed by several
episodes of emesis. Denies chest pain, SOB, diaphoresis. In OSH
[**Name (NI) **], pt was afebrile, hemodynamically stable, but found to have
blood sugar to 555, bicarb 18, anion gap 25, and ABG 7.27/38/73.
EKG was performed which showed diffuse ST depressions in V3-V6,
1, 2, AVF which were new from EKG from [**3-16**]. CPK and Tn were
negative but given DM, he was started on IV heparin and
integrillin and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath. Per OSH report,
head CT and CXR were negative. Repeat EKG showed decreased ST
depressions with 2nd Tn of 0.11 and CPK 153/MB 12. Recent
increased anion gap closed to 18. Pt remained chest pain free on
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].

?ST elevation in V1, low limb voltage
.
old EKG ([**3-16**]): sinus brady @80 with atrial ectopy, low limb
voltage, nl axis/interval, no ST changes

Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD: Initial EKG showed marked depressions in v3-6. On
admission to the CCU, art line was placed, after which pt was
noted to be bradycardic to the 40s and hypotensive to 70s
according to the art line. Pt was bolused with IVF without
significant increase in BP. Dopamine was started. Pt was
asymptomatic. Pt was taken emergently to the cath lab as we were
concerned about acute ischemia. Pt was found to have diffuse
disease and 60-70% stenosis of LCx. In retrospect, pt's
hypotensive episode was most likely spurious, as the arterial
line BP and cuff pressures did not correlate. Cuff pressures did
not drop below 90s systolic during the entire time. Pt may have
some arterial stenosis which led to spurious BP. By cardiac
enzymes, pt was found to have NSTEMI with peak CK of 573 and
peak Tn of 1.09. Pt was started on Aspirin, Statin, plavix. BB
and ACE were initially held in setting of ""hypotension"", but
then was started. Later, decision was made to perform another
cath and to stent the LCx lesion which was done successfully.

2. DM: Pt was admitted in DKA with AG 17. He was started on
insulin drip and IVF and frequent electrolyte checks/repletions.
Gap was successfully closed. Pt was transitioned to insulin
pump.

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 72-year-old male
with coronary artery disease status post myocardial
infarction, CHF with an ejection fraction of 15% and ICD for
DF/VT.  Here for possible ICD malfunction after he was
shocked three times at home the night before admission to an
outside hospital.  The first shock occurred on the morning
prior to admission with no preceding symptoms.  The second
shock occurred while walking downstairs, and he reported
reaching out his arm.  Third shock occurred shortly after
this when he was reaching out with his left hand, and the
final and fourth shock occurred when he was reaching out in
bed with his left arm and received multiple shocks in a row.

At the outside hospital, the patient had a magnet placed over
his ICD, and was given magnesium sulfate.  He was
hemodynamically stable, and had no complaints otherwise.

On review of symptoms, the patient reported occasional
orthostatic hypotension, but denied chest pain, shortness of
breath, nausea, or vomiting.  The patient denies fever or
chills.  Denied bloody stools or black stools.  The patient
denied orthopnea, PND, or dyspnea.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction
and ischemic cardiomyopathy.
2. ICD for VF with second SVC coil because of high DFTs with
three-lead fracture in 03/99.
3. Atrial fibrillation.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency.
5. CHF with an EF of 15%.
6. Hypercholesterolemia.
7. Obesity.
8. History of unsuccessful VT ablation.
9. Osteoarthritis.
10. BPH.
11. Reactive airway disease.
12. Diabetes mellitus type 2.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Toprol 50 b.i.d.
2. Vasotec 10 b.i.d.
3. Lasix 40 b.i.d.
4. Imdur 60 q.d.
5. Lanoxin 125 mcg.
6. Levoxyl 125 mcg.
7. Lipitor 40.
8. Plavix 75.
9. Spironolactone 25.
10. Dofetilide 250 q.d.
11. Coumadin 10 two days a week, 7.5 five days a week.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient reports coronary artery disease in
his father.  [**Name (NI) **] also has a 50 pack year smoking history, but
quit 34 years ago.  He denies alcohol use.

ALLERGIES:  Shellfish and IV dye, which causes hives, and
amiodarone which caused edema.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.7, heart rate of
80, blood pressure 86/52, respiratory rate 16.  Saturating
97% on room air.  Patient was alert and oriented times three
in no acute distress.  Neck was supple.  Pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light.  Clear oropharynx.  There was
no JVD and no carotid bruits.  Cardiovascular reveals
regular, rate, and rhythm with occasional irregular beats.
Faint systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal
border.  Respiratory:  Lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities revealed trace bilateral lower extremity edema.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiac rhythm:  Patient is admitted with multiple shocks
from his ICD.  The shocks had occurred when the patient was
using his left arm predominantly.  This is likely due to the
fact that there was a device malfunction.  The device was
interrogated, and found to be oversensing noise from certain
arm movements.  The device was turned off and programmed DDD.
The INR was 2.5, so the patient was given vitamin K with plan
for future need revision.

Overnight the patient had a four-second pause on telemetry,
although the patient was asymptomatic.  The patient returned
to the Electrophysiology Laboratory and had a pacing catheter
placed.  The patient was transferred to the CCU on [**2126-5-7**] for further monitoring in the setting of transvenous
pacing.  The patient remained comfortable and when his INR
trended down, he returned to the EP Laboratory for device
revision and lead revision.  Patient tolerated the procedure
well.

After this, the patient returned to the [**Hospital3 **]
floors and received multiple shocks on the morning, which
were appropriate for ventricular tachycardia.  The patient's
pacemaker was interrogated and found to be functioning well.
It was reprogrammed to over pace out of ventricular
tachycardia prior to shocking.  The patient had additional
episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which were successfully
paced out of by his pacemaker.  Patient was started on
lidocaine drip given his significant ventricular tachycardia
and the episodes of VT diminished significantly.  The patient
was transitioned to mexiletine on the next day, and tolerated
this well.  The patient had no further episodes of
significant ventricular tachycardia.

2. Coronary artery disease:  The patient currently had no
symptoms.  He was continued on his Plavix, statin,
beta-blocker, and Imdur.  Patient was not admitted on an
aspirin, although he was given an aspirin during his
hospitalization given the fact that was Coumadin was held.
Plan for no aspirin on discharge with resuming his Coumadin
as per his prior home regimen.

3. Congestive heart failure:  Patient has an ischemic
cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of less than 20%.
An echocardiogram on this hospitalization again revealed an
ejection fraction of 15-20%.  While the patient was NPO
during episodes of this hospitalization, his Lasix and
aldactone was held; however, he was continued on his Lasix,
aldactone, digoxin, and ACE inhibitor.  Patient had no
evidence of congestive heart failure during this
hospitalization and he resumed his prior medications before
discharge.

4. Endocrine:  Patient with hypothyroidism:  The patient was
continued on his Levoxyl.  He was also maintained on a
regular insulin-sliding scale.  Blood sugars remained in
normal levels, and he did not require significant amounts of
insulin.

5. Renal:  Patient with chronic renal insufficiency.
Remained stable throughout this hospitalization.

6. Heme:  Patient's INR was reversed with vitamin K, and the
patient was instructed to resume Coumadin dosing on the
evening following discharge.  The patient will follow up with
his cardiologist or primary care physician for further
monitoring of his INR and adjustment of his Coumadin dose.

7. ID:  The patient had a temperature greater than 101.5
following his pacemaker placement, and therefore was
continued on his cephalosporin, which was originally given
for prophylaxis.  The patient was transitioned to p.o.
antibiotics, plan for seven-day course.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. ICD firing.
2. ICD revision.
3. Ventricular tachycardia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Furosemide 40 b.i.d.
2. Spironolactone 25 q.d.

 CHEST, 1 VIEW:

 HISTORY:  Post-op CABG.

 COMPARISON:  [**2177-8-26**]

 This is the immediate post-op film.

 ETT is in good position approximately 3.9 cm above the carina.  The exact
 location of the tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter is obscured by overlying
 hardware.  However, it appears to be in the right atrium and is not in the
 pulmonary artery outflow tract or pulmonary artery.  It should be refloated
 with a repeat chest x-ray performed.  There are two mediastinal tubes in
 adequate position.  There is apparently no chest tube.

 At the base of the left lung is a focal lucency which may represent a small
 pneumomediastinum.  Attention to this region should be paid on the repeat
 film.  There are bands of linear density in the lower third of the left lung
 consistent with atelectasis or infiltrate.

 IMPRESSION:  NG tubes and Swan-Ganz catheter need to be repositioned.  These
 findings were discussed with _________ in the CSRU at 3:20 P.M.

 Question left pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.  Follow up examination is

 INDICATION:  CAD, evaluate for pneumothorax.

 COMPARISON:  [**2177-9-1**].

 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP portable supine chest.

 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in place with tip terminating in the upper
 trachea, in satisfactory position.  A right internal jugular sheath and right
 venous access catheter with tip terminating in the distal SVC.  Nasogastric
 tube with tip terminating in the upper stomach.  Two (2) mediastinal drains.
 There is again seen, pneumopericardium, which appears unchanged from the
 previous examination.  The right chest wall is excluded from the radiograph.
 Allowing for this, no definite pneumothorax is visualized.  Left pleural
 effusion.  Linear opacity at the left base, consistent with atelectasis.  Hazy
 interstitial opacities bilaterally, consistent with mild congestive heart
 failure, slightly improved.  The osseous structures appear unchanged.

 IMPRESSION

 1.  Stable appearance of pneumomediastinum/pneumopericardium.  No evidence of
     pneumothorax.

 2.  Left-sided pleural effusion, and slight improvement in congestive heart
 failure.

 3.  Bibasilar atelectasis.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: The right ventricle is not well seen.

AORTA: The aortic root is moderately dilated.

AORTIC VALVE: The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild (1+)
aortic regurgitation is seen.

MITRAL VALVE: The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Moderate (2+)
mitral regurgitation is seen.

TRICUSPID VALVE: The tricuspid valve leaflets are normal. Mild tricuspid [1+]
regurgitation is seen.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: The pulmonic valve leaflets appear
structurally normal. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.

PERICARDIUM: There is no pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
Technically very difficult study with very poor visualisation of cardiac
structures. The left atrium is mildly dilated. The left atrium is elongated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is at least moderately depressed.
There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction including
hypokinesis of the inferior and inferoseptal walls and Anteroseptal walls. All
other walls including apex are not visualised well.. The aortic root is
moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. Mild
(1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Mild- moderate pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Service:  [**Hospital Unit Name 196**]

IDENTIFICATION/CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male
with a history of coronary artery disease, re-do coronary
artery bypass grafting and hypertension, who presented to an
outside hospital with unstable angina.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease:
    a) The patient had coronary artery bypass grafting with a
saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending artery,
a saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse marginal artery, a
saphenous vein graft to the third obtuse marginal artery and
a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.
    b) He had re-do coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2170**]
with a saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending
artery with no bypass grafts to total occlusions of right
coronary artery and obtuse marginal artery grafts.
    c) In [**2172-3-5**], the patient had a stent of the
saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending artery
with a cardiac catheterization showing a left ventricular end
diastolic pressure of 17, an ejection fraction of 42% and mid
inferior akinesis and anterolateral akinesis/hypokinesis.
    d) In [**2172-6-2**], the patient had a percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty of a saphenous vein graft
to the left anterior descending artery with a left
ventricular end diastolic pressure of 19.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of
1.9.
5.  Hernia repair.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
Enalapril 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. q.d.
Sublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:  There were no known drug allergies.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was doing well post
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2172-6-2**].
On [**2172-10-11**], he developed back pain while sitting.
This involved radiation to his left arm and also some
retrosternal chest pain.  He also described some slight
shortness of breath with nausea and diaphoresis.  This
episode of chest pain was not initially relieved with
sublingual nitroglycerin and the patient presented to [**Hospital6 18075**].

At [**Hospital6 2561**], the patient was found to have no
acute electrocardiogram changes and laboratory investigation
showed a CBC with a white blood cell count of 10.7, a
hematocrit of 36.6, a platelet count of 291 and a Chem 7
which was within normal limits with a BUN of 50 and a
creatinine of 1.9.  His CK, MB and troponin I were noted to
be 64, 2.6 and 0.2.  His second set of enzymes were also
normal.  The patient was admitted and his chest pain was
treated with nitroglycerin and heparin drips.  He was also
noted to have an asymptomatic run of ventricular tachycardia
of 27 beats without any hemodynamic compromise.  The patient
was started on a lidocaine infusion at that time.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2172-10-14**] and was taken straight to the
cardiac catheterization laboratory.  There, he was found to
have a cardiac output and cardiac index of 3.1 and 1.8
respectively.  His right ventricular end diastolic pressure
was 16 and his pulmonary artery pressures were 48/28 with a
mean of 39.  His wedge pressure was noted to be 29 and his
mixed venous oxygen saturation was 42.  No left ventricular
angiography was done.

Examination of the coronary arteries showed a right dominant
system with a normal left main coronary artery.  There was a
99% lesion at the first obtuse marginal artery and a 100%
lesion at the second obtuse marginal artery.  His
posterolateral ventricular branch was noted to be occluded at
30%.  The right coronary artery, which had a previous known
occlusion, was not injected.  The patient's saphenous vein
graft to left anterior descending artery stent was found to
be 98% occluded and the patient underwent balloon
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and subsequent
brachytherapy with a residual occlusion of 10%.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denied any history of tobacco
use.  He consumed alcohol socially and currently lived alone
without support.  The patient was capable of doing his own
shopping, cooking, cleaning and driving.  He did have a
health care proxy by the name of [**Name (NI) 1743**] [**Name (NI) 7049**], who resided
at 74 [**Hospital1 36830**]in [**Hospital1 2436**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  The family history was noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient was in no
apparent distress with vital signs showing a temperature of
96.9??????F, a blood pressure of 138/63, a heart rate of 87, a
respiratory rate of 20 and an oxygen saturation of 96% on a
nonrebreather mask.  The neurological examination was
unremarkable.  The patient was awake, alert and oriented
times three.  On head and neck examination, the pupils were
equal and reactive to light.  The extraocular movements were
intact.  The oropharynx was moist.

On cardiovascular examination, the patient's jugular venous
pressure was 8-10 cm above the sternal angle.  He had a
normal S1 and S2 with an S3 and S4.  He did not have any
audible murmurs.  The respiratory examination showed diffuse
crackles half way up his chest bilaterally with no wheezes.
The abdominal examination was unremarkable.  The extremities
showed palpable bilateral dorsalis pedis pulses with no
edema.  He had a right groin pulmonary artery catheter line
in place and his arterial sheath site was clean, dry and
intact with no bruit or hematoma.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient's cardiac care unit laboratory
values showed a white blood cell count of 14,200, hematocrit
of 27.6 and platelet count of 211,000.  Chem 7 showed a
sodium of 129, potassium of 4.1, chloride of 97, bicarbonate
of 18, BUN of 46, creatinine of 2.1 and glucose of 217.  CK
was 555, calcium was 9.0 and magnesium was 1.6.   Arterial
blood gases showed a pH of 7.33, a pCO2 of 29 and a pO2 of
90.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  The patient's electrocardiogram on
[**2172-10-12**] showed him to be in sinus rhythm at 60
with a prolonged P-R interval, a normal P wave and a QRS axis
of -60 to -90.  He also had a right bundle branch block with
a left anterior hemiblock.  He had Q waves noted in leads III
and aVF.  He also had some premature ventricular
contractions.  There were T wave inversions in leads V1 to
V4, which appeared unchanged from his electrocardiogram from
[**2172-7-1**].

RADIOLOGY DATA:  The patient's chest x-ray showed significant
pulmonary vascular redistribution cephalad.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Following cardiac catheterization, the
patient was continued on Plavix and received aggressive
diuresis for his elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
On [**2172-10-15**], the patient was noted to have
continued runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and an
echocardiogram was done, which showed the patient to have a
moderately depressed left ventricular function with 1+ aortic
insufficiency, 2+ mitral regurgitation and 1+ tricuspid
regurgitation.  He also was noted to have inferior and
inferoseptal hypokinesis.  The pulmonary artery catheter was
removed along with the introducer on that day.

On [**2172-10-16**], the patient was noted to be in atrial
bigeminy in the morning and also continued to have short runs
of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia of three to four
beats.  The patient continued with his intravenous diuresis
with 80 mg of Lasix q.d. and was subsequently transferred to
the floor.  On [**2172-10-17**], the electrophysiology
department was informally consulted and the patient's
metoprolol dose was increased.  The patient's rhythm
continued to be monitored.

On [**2172-10-19**], the patient was in stable condition
with adequate diuresis.  His nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia continued to improve and the patient continued to
show no further episodes of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia.

The patient was discharged home on [**2172-10-19**] in
stable condition.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
Metoprolol 37.5 mg p.o. q.d.
Enalapril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. q.d.
Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual every five minutes p.r.n.
times three.

 PORTABLE AP CHEST:  This is a technically limited study, secondary to
 inability to move and properly position the patient.  There is also motion
 artifact.  Note that a significant portion of the left lateral hemithorax is
 not included.

 An ET tube appears to be in satisfactory position.  The mediastinum is
 prominent, which may be related to the patient's recent surgical procedure and
 AP view of this film.  The cardiac silhouette is prominent.  There appears to
 be left lower lobe collapse/consolidation.  There is right basilar
 atelectasis.

 IMPRESSION;  Limited study.  Prominent mediastinum, which may be secondary to
 patient positioning and recent surgical procedure.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.

 INDICATION:  Status post tracheal stenosis and resection.  Desaturation.

 CHEST AP:  Comparison is made to the prior film dated [**2170-4-5**].  This is a
 very limited study due to patient's motion and underpenetration.  There is
 persistent prominence of the mediastinum, which may related to patient
 position.  There is slight cardiomegaly and mild vascular engorgement with
 bilateral perihilar haziness.  The above findings are consistent with CHF,
 however, aspiration cannot be rule out.  There is persistent left lower lobe
 collapse/consolidation, associated with a left-sided pleural effusion. No
 apparent pneumothorax.

 IMPRESSION:  Very limited study, and chest radiograph will be repeated today.
 Persistent left lower lobe opacity and pleural effusion. Mild CHF.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:

 Compared to 2 days earlier.

 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Oxygen desaturation, status post tracheal surgery.

 The examination is somewhat limited due to flexion of the patient's neck,
 resulting in obscuration of the lung apices.  A portion of the left lung has
 also been excluded from the study laterally.

 There is stable widening of the mediastinum.  The heart is upper limits of
 normal in size for portable supine technique.  The pulmonary vascularity is
 distinct compared to previously hazy appearance.  There has also been improved
 aeration in the left lower lobe.  There is probably a left pleural effusion
 and some residual atelectasis.

 IMPRESSION:
 1)  Interval resolution of mild heart failure pattern.
 2)  Improving aeration in the left lower lobe, with residual opacity which
 likely reflects atelectasis and effusion.

Date of Birth:   [**2124-9-29**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Thoracic Surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Tracheal stenosis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 45-year-old
male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
and obstructive sleep apnea who underwent uvulopalatotectomy
in [**2165**].  This was complicated by hemorrhage and a
tracheostomy for a period of two weeks.

Subsequently, he has had multiple dilatations for the
tracheal stenosis.  He is now here for tracheal
reconstruction.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Obstructive sleep apnea, status post uvulopalatotectomy.
 2.  Tracheostomy for two weeks in [**2165**].
 3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 4.  Hypertension.
 5.  Atrial fibrillation.  The patient has failed several
direct cardioversions.
 6.  Alcohol abuse.
 7.  History of cardiac catheterization in [**2169-6-28**]
with an ejection fraction of 69% and clean coronaries.
 8.  Kidney stones.
 9.  Umbilical hernia.
10.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Flovent, Atrovent, albuterol,
guaifenesin 500 mg p.o. q.d., prednisone 60 mg p.o. q.d.,

p.o. q.d., Coumadin (which has been held).

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy
and direct laryngoscopy, tracheal resection and
reconstruction on [**2170-4-4**].  His intraoperative course was
uneventful.  He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit
postoperatively in an intubated condition.  He remained
intubated overnight and was in a stable condition.

He was extubated on postoperative day one.  He remained in
atrial fibrillation at this time.  He was started on a
diltiazem drip for the atrial fibrillation with a rate
of 150s.  He underwent a bronchoscopy which showed mild
anastomotic edema and was therefore continued on diuresis.
He remained in the Intensive Care Unit for the next few days
slowly improving with aggressive respiratory treatment.  His
Coumadin was restarted on postoperative day three.  He was
continued on antibiotics of vancomycin and Flagyl which had
been started in the initial postoperative period.

On postoperative day six, he complained of some left lower
extremity pain.  He underwent a lower extremity noninvasive
study which revealed a left lower extremity deep venous
thrombosis.  At this point, he was started on Lovenox as he
was not yet therapeutic on his Coumadin.

On [**2170-4-10**], he underwent another bronchoscopy which
again revealed mucosal edema at the anastomotic site.  In the
next few days in the Intensive Care Unit were essentially
uneventful as he slowly improved, and his respiratory
function was slowly improving.

He was deemed ready for transfer to the regular floor on
postoperative day eight.  He was stable on the floor over the
next few days.  His Coumadin was continued until it reached a
therapeutic level, and at that point the Lovenox was stopped.
He continued to have left leg pain secondary to the deep
venous thrombosis and was treated with a morphine
patient-controlled analgesia.  He had aggressive respiratory
toilet as well at this point.  His clinical condition slowly
improved, and he started ambulating, and his respiratory
function improved as well.

On postoperative day 16 ([**2170-4-20**]), he went back to the
operating room for a bronchoscopy.  At that time, his airways
were clean, and there was no mucosal edema.  He was now ready
for discharge home on Coumadin.

 INDICATION:  82 y/o man with sepsis. Evaluate for cause for patient's sepsis.

 TECHNIQUE: Axial CT imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed after
 the intravenous administration of 150 cc of Optiray. Nonionic contrast used
 due to patient's debility. No comparison studies are available for comparison.

 CT CHEST WITH CONTRAST: There are multiple small prominent mediastinal lymph
 nodes which are pathologic in size by CT criteria. There is no evidence of
 hilar or axillary lymphadenopathy. A nonspecific soft tissue density is
 present within the soft tissues of the left anterior chest wall. There is
 evidence of marked emphysema.  There is a spiculated noncalcified pulmonary
 nodule within the left lung apex measuring 1.0 x 0.9 cm. There is no evidence
 of pulmonary parenchymal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. The
 heart, pericardium, and great vessels are within normal limits. There is a
 small axial hiatal hernia.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The liver, gallbladder, and adrenals are within
 normal limits. There is an absent spleen.  The pancreas is atrophic. There is
 a nonspecific rounded lesion with peripheral calcification near the tail of
 the pancreas. There is evidence of nonspecific mild stranding surrounding both
 kidneys in the perirenal spaces. Both kidneys enhance symmetrically with no
 evidence of renal mass or hydronephrosis.  There are multiple bilateral
 prominent parapelvic cysts.  There is a calcified abdominal aorta. The
 proximal celiac axis and SMA are patent. There is no abnormal dilatation or
 wall thickening within large and small bowel. There is no free air, free fluid
 or intra abdominal abscess.  There are multiple small mesenteric lymph nodes
 none of which reach pathologic size by CT criteria.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There is a Foley catheter within a collapsed urinary
 bladder  with wall thickening. The prostate gland is prominent.  The rectum is
 within normal limits. There is no evidence of inflammatory change in the right
 lower quadrant of the abdomen to suggest appendicitis.

 IMPRESSION:

 1) Nonspecific fat stranding surrounding both kidneys which are otherwise
 within normal limits.

 2) Marked emphysema.

 3) Spiculated noncalcified pulmonary nodule measuring 1 cm within the left
 lung apex.  Although this could prepresent infection, this finding is
 worrisome for neoplasm and requires further evaluation.

 4) Nonspecific cystic lesion within the tail of the pancreas with peripheral
 calcification measuring 1.7 x 1.3 cm. Please note that the patient had a
 resection of the tail of the pancreas for a serous cystadenoma in the past.
 This could represent a post surgical collection or a second focus of disease.

 5) Bladder wall thickening.  In the absence of a positive urinalysis, this
 could reflect the sequelae of long standing prostate hypertrophy.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: The left atrium is normal in size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: The right atrium is normal in size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is normal (LVEF>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

AORTIC VALVE: The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not
stenotic. No aortic regurgitation is seen.

MITRAL VALVE: The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. There is mild mitral annular calcification. There is
mild thickening of the mitral valve chordae. The tips of the papillary muscles
are calcified. There is no significant mitral stenosis. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. The left ventricular inflow pattern is normal for age.

TRICUSPID VALVE: The tricuspid valve appears structurally normal with trivial
tricuspid regurgitation.

PERICARDIUM: There is no pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality due to poor echo windows. The
absence of a vegetation by 2D echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis
if clinically suggested.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF 60-70%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but not stenotic. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial
mitral regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion. The absence of
a vegetation by 2D echocardiography does not exclude endocarditis if

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 82-year-old man
without a past medical history except for longstanding
asthma, who presents to the Emergency Department after having
seen his primary care this morning, and noted to have a
temperature of 103 F.  Patient reports that he was in his
usual state of health last evening, however, but he awoke
this morning feeling generally unwell and subsequently had an
episode of nausea and vomiting with subjective fevers.
Patient denies chills.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for chronic nonproductive cough.
Negative for pleuritic chest pain, abdominal pain, dysuria,
or frequency, diarrhea, or hematochezia.  He denies sick
contacts or travel history.  He has had no hospitalizations
since [**2112**] at which time he had resection of a distal
pancreatic mass and splenectomy.

In the Emergency Department, the patient's temperature was
101.6 with stable vital signs.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 101.6, blood
pressure 126/42, heart rate 67, respirations 18, and
saturating 96% on room air.  Generally, the patient was in no
acute distress.  HEENT exam was unremarkable.  He had no
lymphadenopathy in the cervical or axillary regions.  Heart
sounds were normal.  Lung exam was significant for coarse
breath sounds.  Abdomen was benign.  Extremities:  He had
trace to +1 edema bilaterally.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 33.5 with
81% neutrophils, 12% bands, 6% lymphocytes, hematocrit 42.8,
platelets 545.  Chem-7 was unremarkable.  Lactate was 4.4.
Urinalysis was negative.

Chest x-ray:  Negative for consolidation or effusion.

Blood cultures:  Negative.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit according to the MUST sepsis
protocol.  No infectious source was found.  Patient's white
blood cell count continued to trend down on ceftriaxone,
which he was continued on for five days after which point he
was changed to oral Levaquin for a total of 14-day course.
Despite the diagnosis of fever of unknown origin, suspicion
for endocarditis was extremely low, and transthoracic
echocardiogram was also negative for vegetation.  Patient
became afebrile two days after admission and continued to be
afebrile throughout his hospital course.

Lung nodule:  CT torso was done to evaluate potential
abscesses, which could be the source of the patient's fever.
Incidentally, it was noted that patient had a spiculated
noncalcified pulmonary nodule measuring 1 cm in diameter from
the left lung apex.  CT Surgery consulted during this
admission, and recommended a repeat CT scan in one month with
outpatient followup.

Asthma/emphysema:  Patient was continued on his Flovent and
Serevent.  He has no record of pulmonary function tests and
this will be done as an outpatient.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Sepsis, fever of unknown origin.
2. Pulmonary nodule seen incidentally on CAT scan.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient was instructed to followup
with his primary care doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2903**] in one week.  He was
also instructed to have a repeat CAT scan on his chest in one
month and this was scheduled for [**2117-1-26**].  He is
also to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**], Cardiothoracic Surgery
after this CT scan.  Lastly, he is to followup to get
pulmonary function tests on [**1-20**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.  Patient was afebrile and
clinically at his baseline.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Serevent 50 mcg one inhalation p.o. q.12h.
2. Flovent two puffs b.i.d.
3. Levofloxacin 500 mg one p.o. q.d. for eight days to
complete a 14-day course.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  85-year-old man, evaluate for aortic calcification.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
 thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis.  Multiplanar reconstructions were
 performed.

 CONTRAST:  100 cc of IV Optiray contrast were administered due to the rapid
 rate of bolus injection required for this study.

 CTA OF THE CHEST:  No filling defects or pulmonary emboli are identified
 within the pulmonary arteries to the level of the subsegmental branches. There
 is extensive aortic calcification along the aortic arch, which is ectatic in
 appearance.  Additionally, the superior portion of the aorta in the abdomen is
 dilated, measuring 4.6 x 4.5 cm ( series  3, image 95).  There is no evidence
 of aortic dissection.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The soft tissue window images demonstrate
 bilateral simple appearing pleural effusions.  This is associated adjacent
 compressive atelectasis.  Additionally, there is diffuse ground glass opacity
 adjacent to this, with intralobular septal thickening, consistent with changes
 from pulmonary edema.  Scattered mediastinal lymph nodes are noted, without
 any evidence of pathologic enlargement.  Coronary artery calcifications are
 noted.  No pulmonary nodules or focal parenchymal consolidation is seen.

 There is limited evaluation of the superior portion of the abdomen, and the
 visualized portions of the liver, spleen, and stomach within normal limits.

 BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions identified.  Extensive
 degenerative changes are seen within the thoracic spine.

 CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Multiplanar reconstructions were essential in delineating
 the anatomy and pathology.

 IMPRESSION:
 1)  No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
 2)  Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.  Findings
 consistent with associated moderate pulmonary edema.
 3)  Extensive aortic calcification.  There is focal upper abdominal aortic

 FINDINGS:

 As compared to the previous radiograph, the external pacemaker is no longer
 coiled within the superior SVC.  The wire shows a hook-like configuration in
 the SVC.  There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.

 Newly placed nasogastric tube with a course widely deviated from the midline.
 However, the course does not indicate airway intubation.  The tube must be
 advanced, given that the sidehole is located at the level of the middle third

1. Intubation
2. Permanent Pacemaker Placement


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 66794**] is an 89 year old gentleman with a history of
atrial fibrillation on amiodarone and coumadin, CAD with 3VD
seen on cardiac cath in [**2186**], CHF with EF of 20%, who initially
presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] last night complaining of a slow heart
beat.  Per his wife at around midnight last night he came to bed
complaining that his heart was beating very slowly, he felt weak
and that he could ""feel it in his chest.""  At that time he asked
his wife to call 911 and he was taken to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for further
evaluation.  Per his wife he did not complain of any chest pain,
shortness of breath or nausea.  Also, the family notes that he
has been having some falls/syncope at home including one event
that he did not remember in the past few weeks.
.
Per EMS report he was found to be pale, cool and diaphoretic on
initial examination.  There he experienced some nausea, vomited
once, appropriate but lethargic, he was found to be bradycardic
to the 20's to 30's and was taken to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].  En route to
[**Location (un) 620**] he was given atropine 0.5mg x 2 with no effect, he was
put on external pacing with electrical but not mechanical
capture.  At [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] he was still bradycardic initially to
the 20's, was given atropine 1mg x 2, a right cordis was placed
and pacing wires were floated but kinked and were unable to
capture.  His CK was 87, CK-MB was 2.1.  He was then intubated
for reported AMS, external pacing was again attempted but there
was no mechanical capture.  Throughout his course he was never
hypotensive with his episodes of bradycardia.  EKG's done at [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] showed at times a junctional rhythm, ventricular escape
and then bradycardia with his old LBBB.  He was then transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER his initial VS were: 96.8, 63,
113/60, 99% on 14x450, 5 PEEP, FiO2 of 100%.  His heart rate
remained in the 50's, he was given fentanyl/versed for sedation,
an OGT was placed and he was transferred to the CCU.  VS on
transfer were: 96, 51, 124/59, 97% on the above ventilator
settings.  His CK was 88, CK-MB was 4 with a troponin of 0.04.
On arrival to the CCU his initial VS were: 97, 43, 130/57, 22,
100% on AC 14x450, PEEP of 5, FiO2 of 60%.  He is currently
intubated and sedated, unable to respond to any questions, he is
moving his extremities.

The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed
(LVEF= 20-25 %) with global hypokinesis (and inferior akinesis).
No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no
ventricular septal defect. with mild global free wall
hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened
but aortic stenosis is not present. Mild (1+) aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate
([**1-9**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The tricuspid valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is mild pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.
.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2188-4-7**],
the LV appears more dysynchronous
.
CXR [**2191-2-23**] Cardiomegaly with mild pulmonary edema. The
widened mediastinum may represent an enlarged aneurysmal
thoracic aorta or an aortic dissection.


Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. [**Known lastname 66794**] is an 89 year old gentleman with a history of
atrial fibrillation on amiodarone/coumadin, CAD with 3VD, CHF
with EF of 20% who presented with symptomatic bradycardia.  He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for permanenet pacemaker placement.
Hospital course complicated by brief intubation for altered
mental status.
.
# RHYTHM / BRADYCARDIA: Review of EKGs prior to admission reveal
sinus arrest after a junctional rhythm and subsequent
ventricular escape.  When he returned into sinus rhythm he had a
wider QRS interval and prolonged PR interval of 300 ms thank on
prior EKGs.  Etiology unclear, may be secondary to conversion
pause or a toxic or metabolic condition pre-empting sinus arrest
with long PR and wide QRS.  A free T4 was normal. The patient's
home dose of amiodarone was held with concern for toxicity.  A
temporary pacemaker was placed and noted to be coiled in the IVC
and was thus subsequently removed.  Coumadin was held in
anticipation of pacemaker placement.  A permanent pacemaker was
placed on HD 2.  Although the patient is a given EF of 20%
candidate for biventricular ICD placement, dicussion with the
patient and primary cardiologist prompted placement of pacemaker
only, to place the simplest device that would address his
bradycardia. Coumadin was restarted post procedure at his home
regimen, with follow-up at the [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] coumadin clinic.
.
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient has a history of three
vessel disease and was not on a statin or beta blocker as an
outpatient.  He was started on atorvastatin 80mg daily, aspirin
325 mg daily.  His cardiac enzymes were cycled and flat.  Lipid
panel revealed an LDL of 105, HDL of 33 and total cholesterol of
173, the atorvastatin was discontinued at the time of discharge.
.
# AIRWAY PROTECTION: The patient was intubated prior to
admission to the intensive care unit due to altered mental
status in the setting of symptomatic bradycardia.  He was
successfully extubated on admission to the CCU.
.
# SYSTOLIC CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE: Most recent echo prior to
admission demonstrated EF of 20%. An echo on admission was
similar demonstrating more dysynchronous LV function. The
patient was continued on lisinopril at his outpatient dose of
5mg daily.
.
# HYPERTENSION: All antihypertensive medications were held given
bradycardia, and then restarted after pacemaker placement, he
was discharged on his home regimen.
.
# HYPOTHYROID:  The patient was continued on home synthroid at
225mcg daily.  Free T4 was normal with elevation of TSH.  He was
dischargard on his home dose with outpatient PCP follow up for
further titration of his synthroid.
.
# GLAUCOMA: continued on his outpatient eye drop regimen
.
TRANSITIONAL CARE:
1. CODE: FULL
2. FOLLOW-UP: needs coumadin monitoring and PCP follow up for
titration of his synthroid dose given elevated TSH.  He will
follow up with the EP device clinic and also with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] for
continued outpatient cardiology care.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 66794**],

You were recently admitted to the Cardiac Intesive Care Unit for
a low heart rate, which made you feel ill. You presented
intubated (tube in your lungs helping you breathe), which was
quickly taken out. You had a pacemaker placed to help keep your
heart rate within a normal range. You tolerated this procedure
well.
.
In the hospital we found that your thyroid is not working
properly. For this reason your thyroid medication (Synthroid)
may need to be adjusted. Please remember to take this medication
daily and follow up with your Primary Care Physician to address
this.
.
We are making a few changes to your outpatient medications:
-Please START Keflex 500mg by mouth every 8 hours for the next
three days
-Please START Tramadol 25mg by mouth every 6hrs as needed for
pain
***This can cause drowsiness, do not take this medication when
doing activity.
-Please continue to take your Coumadin at the same dose (5mg
every day except for 2.5mg on Monday on Friday). We spoke with
the [**Hospital3 **] at [**Location (un) 620**]. Please have your labs
drawn on Tuesday [**2191-3-1**] for PT/INR. They will adjust your dose
as needed.
.
-Please continue to take your other medications as instructed

Weigh yourself every morning, [**Name8 (MD) 138**] MD if weight goes up more

Indication: Intraoperative TEE for CABG, AVR, MVR, Seotal myomectomy
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2122-2-10**] at 11:37
Test: TEE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the
body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) 4**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5**] LAA. Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the LAA. All four
pulmonary veins identified and enter the left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA
and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D
images. Moderate symmetric LVH. Small LV cavity. Normal regional LV systolic
function. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal; basal
anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal inferoseptal - normal;
mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior - normal;
basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal anterolateral
- normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal; septal apex -
normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex - normal;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal calcifications in
aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter. Focal calcifications in
ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Focal calcifications in
aortic arch. Mildly dilated descending aorta. Simple atheroma in descending
aorta. Focal calcifications in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened aortic valve
leaflets. Severe AS (AoVA <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate mitral
annular calcification. Moderate MS (MVA 1.0-1.5cm2) Due to co-existing AR, the
pressure half-time estimate of mitral valve area may be an OVERestimation of
true area. Mild to moderate ([**11-25**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the
procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally
reviewed with the MD caring for the patient.

Conclusions:
This patient's intraoperative study is stored on two separate examinations.
The first study, of which there are 72 clips represents pre-CPB images. The
medical record number corresponding to this study is missing the last digit.
The second set of images represents both pre and post CPB clips.

PRE-CPB The left atrium is elongated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen
in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular septum encroaches on the left ventricular outflow tract. The left
ventricular cavity is small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are focal calcifications in the aortic
arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2) by continuity but by planimetry the
aortic valve area is about 1 cm2. This may be due to a subvalvular gradient.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is moderate mitral stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2). Due
to co-existing aortic regurgitation, the pressure half-time estimate of mitral
valve area may be an OVERestimation of true mitral valve area. Mild to
moderate ([**11-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

POST CPB There is normal right ventricular systolic function. There is normal
LV systolic function. The patient is status post septal myomectomy. No
interventricular flow is seen in this area but because of acoustic shadowing
but a small VSD cannot be completely ruled out. A bioprosthesis is located in
the mitral position. It appears well seated and displays normal leaflet
motion. There is evidence of prosthetic mitral valve leaflet [**Male First Name (un) 8**] without LVOT
obstruction. There is trace valvular and perivalvular mitral regurgitation. A
maximum gradient of 13 mm Hg and a mean gradient of 5 mm Hg is measured across
this valve. A bioprosthesis is also noted in the aortic position. It also
appears well seated with normal leaflet function. There is trace valvular AI.
Trace perivalvular AI is also likely present but acoustic shadowing prevents
complete evaluation. There is a significant pressure gradient (between 40-60
mm Hg) noted upon Doppler interrogation of the LVOT and aortic valve. Based on
color and pulse wave Doppler readings, it appears that this gradient is due to
the proximity of the mitral valve prosthesis strut and the ventricular septum.

These findings were discussed in detail with Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 137**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 304**]
in the operating room.

 COMPARISON:  The last available chest radiograph from [**2122-2-3**] was
 obtained preoperatively.

 TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  A portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained in
 supine position at 1415.

 Heart size remains normal.  Lungs are clear except for few linear opacities
 consistent with early postoperative atelectasis, mild.  Transparence of both
 lungs is otherwise symmetric.  An endotracheal tube is present, with its tip
 at the level of the medial ends of the clavicles, approximately 4 cm above the
 carina.  A Swan-Ganz catheter, introduced through a right internal jugular
 venous approach, is in place as well, with its tip at the level of the right
 pulmonary artery. Three chest/mediastinal tubes are visualized, two in the
 midline and one at the left lung base.  A nasogastric tube is seen with its
 tip at the level of the greater tuberosity and its side hole not visualized.
 Prosthetic heart valve, metallic clips and sternotomy wires are noted.
 Calcified polygonal formations in the right upper quadrant are suggestive of
 gallstones.

 CONCLUSION:  Unremarkable early postoperative appearance.  Lines and tubes as
 described above.  No pneumothorax.

 HISTORY:  CABG and aortic valve replacement, status post chest tube removal.

 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated [**2122-2-13**].

 FINDINGS:  Despite the given history, no chest tube has been removed since the
 intervening radiograph.  The endotracheal tube and right internal jugular
 vascular sheath remains stable in position.  A nasogastric tube has been
 placed.  However, it extends off the inferior margin of the radiograph and the
 tip is not seen.  There is a relatively moderately sized posteriorly layering
 pleural effusion.  The pulmonary vasculature is mildly indistinct possibly
 secondary to mild underlying volume overload.  No definite focal consolidation
 is seen.  There is a tortuous aorta.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged
 but stable.  There is stable course and position of the dual chamber
 pacemaker.

 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of nasogastric tube as above.  There is a
 relatively large posteriorly layering left pleural effusion.

 HISTORY:  Atrial flutter and extensive cardiac history.  Assess for interval
 change.

 FINDINGS:

 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated [**2122-2-14**].

 FINDINGS:  The patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube removed.
 The right internal jugular approach vascular sheath remains in place.  There
 is stable course and position of a dual-chamber pacemaker as well.  Despite
 the upright position of the now acquired radiograph, the hazy veiling opacity
 in the left lower hemithorax is again evident with no significant layering of
 the pleural effusion.  This suggests possible loculation.  The opacity is
 atypical for a true parenchymal consolidation.  The right lung is largely
 clear.  There is no pneumothorax.

 IMPRESSION:  Persistent hazy opacity in the left mid lung and base.  Given the
 upright radiograph, the suspected posteriorly layering pleural effusion may
 have loculated components.  The opacity is atypical for a true parenchymal
 consolidation although this cannot be entirely excluded.  If clinically
 feasible, consider bilateral decubitus views or CT scanning for further
 evaluation.

in critical but stable condition paced with complete heart
block. She was extubated and weaned form her vasoactive drips
later that same day. She remained in complete heart block and
was seen by electrophysiology. On [**2-13**] she was reintubated and
had a [**Company 1543**] Sigma dual chamber pacemaker placed. She was
extubated on [**2-14**]. A HIT panel, which was sent for a platelet
count of 63, was negative. She went into aflutter  and was
started on amiodarone and heparin and coumadin. She was
transferred to the floor on POD #5. She converted to sinus
rhythm. Her amiodarone was decreased due to prolonged QTC. Her
activity was advanced with nursung and PT. She was ready for

The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the procedure.

Conclusions:
PRE-CPB: 1.The left atrium is normal in size. No spontaneous echo contrast is
seen in the body of the left atrium. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus
is seen in the body of the left atrium or left atrial appendage. No atrial
septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler.
2. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity
size. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular
systolic dysfunction with apical anterior hypokinesis.. No masses or thrombi
are seen in the left ventricle. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
mildly depressed. Transmitral Doppler and tissue velocity imaging are
consistent with normal LV diastolic function.
3. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal.
4. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated at a maximum of 3.7. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta.
5. There are three aortic valve leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen.
6. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. Physiologic mitral regurgitation is seen (within normal
limits).
7. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.
POST-CPB: Patient is on phenylephrine infusion. Preserved biventricular
systolic function with improvement of the anteroapical hypokinetic segment.

 INDICATION:  Status post coronary artery bypass surgery.

 Endotracheal tube terminates just above the level of the clavicles,
 approximately 6.8 cm above the carina, could be advanced slightly for standard
 positioning.  Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the distal right pulmonary
 artery, nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm, and low lying chest tube
 is present on the left as well as midline mediastinal drains.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are slightly widened, likely due to postoperative change.
 Bilateral subtle chronic interstitial lung disease without change allowing for

 COMPARISON:  [**2131-5-4**]

 INDICATION:  Chest tube removal.

 Various lines and tubes have been removed since the prior radiograph, and a
 very small left apical pneumothorax has developed.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are within normal limits for postoperative status of the patient.
 Small pleural effusions and minor bibasilar atelectasis are noted.  These
 findings are superimposed upon subtle likely more chronic peripheral and
 basilar interstitial lung disease.

 On the lateral view, small air-fluid level is present in the retrosternal
 region likely representing an anterior hydropneumothorax, and additional air
 is present in the retrosternal region, an expected postoperative finding given
 the time interval since surgery.

 IMPRESSION:  Small left pneumothorax following tube removal.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis and small pleural effusions.

Recent testing:
[**2131-4-24**]: Echo showed a normal LV size and function.  EF of
60-65%.  The valves were all normal with trace TR.  Pulmonary
systolic pressure was estimated to be 30-35%. [**2131-4-20**]: Nuclear
stress test where the patient exercised for 6 minutes 57 seconds
on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol stopping due to shortness of breath and leg
pain.  He achieved 68% of his predicted target heart rate.  He
did not develop any arrhythmias or chest pain.  The nuclear
images demonstrated a normal sized left ventricle. There was a
moderate sized reversible perfusion abnormality involving the
anteroapical and septal portion left ventricle. There was also a
question of a small reversible abnormality involving the
inferolateral portion left ventricle.  The left ventricular wall
motion was normal.  The LVEF was 62%.
.
[**2131-4-30**] Cardiac Catheterization
COMMENTS:
1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
severe three vessel coronary artery disease.  The left main
coronary artery had no angiographically apparent flow limiting
stenoses.  The LAD was ectatic proximally and occluded in the
mid segment after a small diagonal.  The LCX had a 90% stenosis
of the OM1 proximally and a 50% followed by a 70% stenosis in
the proximal and mid segment of the OM2. The RCA had a 90%
stenosis in the mid PDA.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly to moderately
elevated left sided filling pressures (LVEDP was 18 mm Hg).
Systemic arterial pressure was normal (aortic pressure was
121/73 mm Hg).  There was no significant gradient across the
aortic valve upon pullback of the catheter from the left
ventricle to the ascending aorta.
3.  Left ventriculography revealed a contrast calculated
ejection
fraction of 65%.  No mitral regurgitation was noted. 4.
Bilateral selective renal angiography demonstrated widely patent
renal arteries.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal left ventricular systolic function.
3. Mildly to moderately elevated left sided filling pressures.
4. No angiographically apparent renal artery stenosis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG with sternal debridement, unstable sternotomy.
 Evaluate sternum.

 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray, [**2131-5-12**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector helical scanning of the chest was performed without
 IV contrast.  Images were displayed using 5-mm slice thickness, in both soft
 tissue and lung algorithm windows.  Additional 2.5-mm images were obtained and
 sagittal images were obtained of both the chest and the sternum.

 NON-CONTRAST CHEST CT:  The patient is status post CABG, with median
 sternotomy wires and numerous CABG clips.  There has been a dehiscence of the
 sternum, with separation of the two sternum measuring up to 1.7 cm near the
 xiphoid process.  The most inferior sternal wires do not include the right
 side of the sternum.  There is also an extensive fluid collection posterior to
 the sternum measuring 10 x 4 cm in the coronal plane.  In the axial plane, the
 fluid collection measures 2.2 x 3.4 cm for the majority of its length, however
 expands to 8 x 1.5 cm at the xiphoid process.  There is also a small amount of
 fluid and stranding in the soft tissues anterior to the sternum.

 Heart size is normal.  There are scattered atherosclerotic calcifications
 within the native coronary vessels.  On this non-contrast scan, the great
 vessels appear unremarkable.  Small mediastinal lymph nodes measuring up to 5
 mm in short axis are noted.  No pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar or
 axillary lymph nodes.

 The bronchi are patent to the subsegmental level.  There are small bilateral
 pleural effusions layering posteriorly with adjacent atelectasis at the lung
 bases.  Additionally throughout the lung parenchyma are peripheral scattered
 ground-glass glass opacities with an upper lobe predominance.  This pattern
 suggests a chronic restrictive or inhalational process, rather than infection.

 Limited views of the upper abdomen demonstrate numerous hypodense lesions
 within the liver, which cannot be fully characterized on this non-contrast
 scan, however likely represent cysts.  Partial view of the right kidney
 demonstrates caliceal fullness, which may represent hydronephrosis (though
 there is no perinephric stranding) or a parapelvic cyst.

 BONE WINDOWS:  See description of sternal dehiscence above.  The vertebral

 column demonstrates degenerative changes of the lower thoracic spine with
 early DISH developing at T9-10 and T10-11.  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic
 lesions.

 Multiplanar reformats confirm the above findings.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Sternal dehiscence with an extensive fluid collection extending along the
 entire length of the sternum.  While this measures simple fluid density,
 infection cannot be excluded.
 2.  Bilateral pleural effusions measuring simple fluid density.
 3.  Scattered peripheral ground-glass opacities with upper lobe predominance
 and scattered foci of peripheral fibrotic changes are more suggestive of
 chronic restrictive or inhalational process, rather than infection.
 4.  Hypodense lesions within the liver are likely cysts, thought cannot be
 fully characterized on this non-contrast scan.
 5.  Right renal pelvic fullness, not completely imaged on this chest CT, may
 reflect mild hydronephrosis or a parapelvic cyst.  Recommend correlation with
 the clinical picture.  If indicated, a right renal ultrasound could further
 evaluate this finding.

ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. The left
ventricular cavity is unusually small and hyperdynamic. There is mild LVH.
Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal. Overall left ventricular
systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. Right ventricular systolic function is borderline
normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch and the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe [3+]
tricuspid regurgitation is seen. All findings discussed with surgeons at the

 SINGLE SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Compared to three hours prior, there
 has been little interval change with the exception of the placement of a right
 internal jugular catheter which terminates in the distal SVC.  The vascular
 sheath has been removed.  Again demonstrated is an endotracheal tube which
 terminates in the mid thoracic trachea, unchanged in position.  Multiple chest
 tubes are again identified.  There are multiple fixation plates overlying the
 mediastinum along with vertically oriented staples and wires consistent with
 provided history.  The hila are prominent bilaterally with diffuse
 interstitial opacities consistent with mild pulmonary edema which appears to
 have improved slightly compared to prior study. There is a large area of
 subtle lucency along the medial left lower lung, raising the possibilty of an
 anterior pneumothorax.

 HISTORY:  69-year-old man status post CABG with new pulmonary embolism,
 evaluate for DVT.

 TECHNIQUE:  Portable ultrasound images of bilateral lower extremities were
 performed at the bedside.

 FINDINGS:

 RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY:  The right common femoral vein is widely patent and
 demonstrates normal compressibility without grayscale evidence for clot.
 Evaluation of the femoral vein (SFV) demonstrates no compression with
 grayscale bulk clot extending along its length.  This clot demonstrates
 moderate occlusion.  The popliteal vein is patent.  The deep femoral vein is
 patent.

 LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY:  The left common femoral vein is widely patent with
 normal compressibility and respiratory augmentation.  The left femoral vein
 (SFV) demonstrates widely patent flow with appropriate compression and
 respiratory augmentation.  The popliteal vein is unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY: Extensive thrombosis of the right femoral vein
 along its entire length and no significant internal flow.
 2.  LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY: No evidence for DVT.

Indication: history of PE, assess PA pressure and RV function
Height: (in) 70
Weight (lb): 240
BSA (m2): 2.26 m2
BP (mm Hg): 122/74
HR (bpm): 92
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2131-5-19**] at 11:09
Test: Portable TEE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the LA/LAA or the
RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Dynamic interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Hyperdynamic LVEF >75%.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity. Moderate global RV free wall
hypokinesis. Abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with RV
pressure overload.

AORTA: Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to moderate [[**1-9**]+] TR.
Severe PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Thickened pulmonic valve leaflets.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion. No echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The patient was monitored
by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) 1**] [**Last Name (Titles) 2**] throughout the procedure. The patient was sedated for
the TEE. Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test Information
section). No TEE related complications.

Conclusions:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. There is moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure overload. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve
leaflets are thickened. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade, however, in the setting of RV pressure
overload, tamponde cannot be entirely ruled out.

Impression: Hyperdynamic mildly hypertrophied LV. Moderately depressed RV with
severe pulmonary hypertension on NO.

Post discontinuation of NO: There is no significant change of RV function or
estimated PA pressure. Tricuspid regurgitation has increased to moderate.

 INDICATION:  A 69-year-old man status post CABG with new PE.  Evaluate for
 DVT.

 COMPARISON:  Study from [**2131-5-12**].

 BILATERAL UPPER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND:  There is limited evaluation of
 the right internal jugular vein.  Grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 864**] was
 performed of the right and left cephalic, basilic, brachial, axillary and
 subclavian veins, and of the left IJ vein.  The right IJ was not visualized
 secondary to overlying bandages.

 Again seen is distention of the left IJ, left cephalic, and right cephalic
 with clot, without intraluminal flow.  There is also new occlusion of the left
 superficial basilic vein.  The remainder of the venous structures demonstrates
 normal flow, compressibility, and augmentation with normal waveforms.

 IMPRESSION:  Persistent areas of intraluminal thrombus in the left IJ, and
 within the superficial veins of the left and right cephalic veins, and new
 thrombus in the superficial left basilic vein.

 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.

 INDICATION:  Status post bypass surgery one week ago, now with chest pain at
 incision site and drainage.  No fevers.  Also has gradual onset of shortness
 of breath and fatigue.  Evaluate for effusions.

 FINDINGS:  Frontal view demonstrates status post anterior chest wall
 reconstruction with four bars of hardware in horizontal position.  Position of
 previously described chest tubes is unchanged including right jugular approach
 central venous line.  No pneumothorax is identified in the apical regions.
 Since the last preceding study of [**5-22**], apparently a right-sided PICC line
 has been added, seen to terminate overlying the SVC some 3 cm above the level
 of the carina.  The mild blunting of the left lateral pleural sinus persists
 and the lateral view discloses also some blunting of the posterior pleural
 sinuses representing postoperative findings.

 Position of longitudinally directed multiple wire loops in the sternal area
 appears unchanged and the row of subcutaneous clips is identified in the
 anterior chest wall suture line, but no significant soft tissue changes can be
 identified.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  69-year-old status post sternal rewiring requiring IV
 antibiotics.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5344**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 169**],
 the attending physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **].

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  Patient was placed supine on the angiographic table.
 Due to prior ultrasounds demonstrating extensive thrombus within the left
 upper extremity, the right upper extremity was chosen for the PICC line.
 Ultrasound demonstrated an appropriate right basilic vein which was punctured
 with a 21-gauge micropuncture needle, through which a 0.018 guide wire was
 advanced into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC trimmed to 35 cm and was advanced
 under fluoroscopic guidance with its tip placed in the distal SVC.  Final
 fluoroscopic image was taken to confirm tip placement.  Hard copy ultrasound
 images were printed before and after venous puncture to confirm patency. There
 are no immediate post-procedure complications.

 IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of 35 cm single lumen PICC via the right
 basilic vein with its tip in the distal SVC; line ready for use.

Pertinent Results:
[**2131-5-13**] Chest CT Scan: Sternal dehiscence with an extensive
fluid collection extending along the entire length of the
sternum. While this measures simple fluid density, infection
cannot be excluded. Bilateral pleural effusions measuring simple
fluid density.
[**2131-5-17**] Echo: There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**2131-5-18**] LE U/S: 1. RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY: Extensive thrombosis
of the right femoral vein along its entire length and no
significant internal flow. 2. LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY: No evidence
for DVT.
[**2131-5-18**] Echo: The right atrium is moderately dilated. A
mass/thrombus associated with a catheter/pacing wire is seen in
the right atrium and/or right ventricle. This mass disappeared
later in the exam. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen
ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with
maneuvers. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small and
hyperdynamic. There is mild LVH. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. Right ventricular systolic function is
borderline normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch
and the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe
[3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. All findings discussed
with surgeons at the time of the exam.
[**2131-5-24**] UE U/S: Persistent areas of intraluminal thrombus in the
left IJ, and within the superficial veins of the left and right
cephalic veins, and new thrombus in the superficial left basilic
vein.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 27218**] was admitted [**5-12**] with sternal instability and
[**Month/Day (1) 1834**] chest CT scan which confirmed sternal dehiscence. It
was also notable for an extensive fluid collection extending
along the entire length of the sternum. He was empirically
started on antibiotics and taken to the operating room on [**5-15**]
for sternal re-wiring. There was no evidence of sternal wound
infection. Postoperatively, he was maintained on antibiotics and
wound irrigation. On [**5-17**] in the early AM, he became acutely
hypotensive and increased his chest tube drainage. Transferred
to the CSRU, Swan placed, and transfused one unit. Emergent Echo
revealed a moderate sized pericardial effusion that appeared
circumferential. His chest was ultimately opened emergently in
the unit for washout, and returned to the OR for complete
washout and a hole in the vein graft was sutured closed. Please
see op reports for surgical details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the with open chest and plastic surgery was
consulted regarding sternal plating. The following day he was
brought back to the operating room for chest closure. Echo done
at that time revealed an acute Pulmonary Embolism/Thrombus in
the RA/RV. This mass/thrombus disappeared later on exam. He then
[**Month/Year (2) 1834**] sternal plating closure/bil. pectoralis flaps done by
plastic surgery. Following surgery he was again transferred back
to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Argatroban started for
presumed HIT (eventually came back negative) and Hematology
consulted. On [**5-21**] he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. Following extubation a
bedside swallow study was done, which he initially failed, but
repeated [**5-23**] with improvement. Also on [**5-23**] he was transferred
to the SDU for further care. Extremity U/S revealed thrombus in
his right femoral vein, left IJ, superficial veins of the left
and right cephalic veins, and in the superficial left basilic
vein. On [**5-24**] a PICC line was placed. Although operative wound
cultures were eventually negative, per ID, he will receive 4
weeks of vancomycin for high risk of sternal contamination. He
continued to improve and worked with physical therapy during his
post-op course for strength and mobility. On [**5-25**] he was
discharged to rehab facility with the appropriate follow-up
appointments. Of note, he will remain on Coumadin for DVT/PE for
minimum of 6 months.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2131-5-19**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. Normal interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV systolic function. Abnormal septal motion/position.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Mildly dilated ascending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. No MS. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized. TR present - cannot be
quantified. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PS.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect.
RV appears to have normal free wall contractility (poor image quality). There
is abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid
regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-5-19**], the RV funciton
has probably improved. If indicated, a cardiac MRI may better assess RV size
and systolic function.

 CHEST X-RAY

 INDICATION:  Endotracheal tube and orogastric tube placement.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a new endotracheal tube has
 been placed.  The tip of the tube projects 3 cm above the carina.  The course
 of the nasogastric tube is unremarkable, but its tip is difficult to identify.

 There is no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax.

 Bilateral chest tubes are in place.  Also unchanged are the sternal fixations.
 In slightly different patient position, the bilateral parenchymal opacities
 that preexisted appears unchanged in extent, with a potential minimal increase
 on the right.

 The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  Also unchanged are the
 retrocardiac areas of atelectasis.

 No other changes.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Normal position of endotracheal tube.  Normal course of nasogastric tube
 with likely normal position in the central parts of the stomach.
 2.  Unchanged course and position of the bilateral chest tubes.  Overall
 unchanged extent of the pre-existing bilateral parenchymal opacities.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PROCEDURE:  CTA chest.

 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess for PE.  Acute hypoxia.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCTA chest was performed initially as a low-dose non-contrast
 protocol followed by administration of IV contrast with transaxial images from
 the apices to the lower lungs with multiplanar reformats.

 The CT was reported in conjunction with the previous CT, [**2131-6-22**].

 FINDINGS:

 There is satisfactory contrast opacification of the pulmonary arteries with a
 filling defect in the lobar left upper lobe pulmonary artery consistent with a
 pulmonary embolus and better seen on the left oblique reformats (402b.71). The
 caliber of the pulmonary artery is normal.  No acute aortic pathology is noted
 on the pre or post-contrast images.
 Centrilobular emphysema is upper lobe predominant and severe.  Diffuse
 geographically distributed ground-glass opacities are throughout the upper
 lobes and in the superior segment of the right lower lobe which have a
 reticular-type appearance due to coexisting centrilobular emphysema.

 The right-sided airways from the bronchus intermedius distally are
 circumferentially narrowed mainly due to retained secretions which are causing
 partial collapse of the right lower lobe; however there may be additional
 thickening of the airways which are difficult to accurately assess due to the
 secretions and surrounding enlarged lymph nodes.
 Bilateral pleural effusions are small and atelectasis in the left lower lobe
 is mild.

 The heart size is normal with a small pericardial effusion which is most
 likely physiological.  Calcification is diffuse throughout the coronary
 arteries with a previous CABG.

 This study was not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation except to note a
 mesh in the anterior upper abdominal soft tissues, consistent with the recent
 ventral hernia repair.Sternal wires and external fixation devices are
 throughout the sternum and sternal drains pass along the anterior chest wall.

 (Cont)
 posterior to the left scapula (2.8) contains tiny septations.
 No destructive or sclerotic bone lesions worrisome for malignancy.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left upper lobe lobar pulmonary embolism.
 2.  Partial right lower lobe collapse due to a combination of dependent
 secretions and bronchial wall thickening, with associated surrounding
 peribronchial lymph nodes which are probably reactive; however, a followup CT
 is recommended in four to six weeks to ensure resolution.
 3.  Diffuse ground-glass opacities superimposed on centrilobular emphysema are
 most likely infectious (such as viral in origin); aspiration and asymetrical
 edema are less likely.
 4.  Large fatty lesion posterior to the left scapula contains internal
 septations; considering large size and septations, a dedicated MRI with
 contrast is recommended for further evaluation to help distinguish a lipoma
 from a low grade liposarcoma.
 5.  New ventral hernia mesh with postoperative changes in the soft tissues of
 the anterior chest and upper abdomen.
 6.  Diffuse coronary artery calcification with CABG.
 The findings of the pulmonary embolism were conveyed to the referring team at
 the time of reporting.

Recurrent ventral herniation with omentum up in the anterior

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ventral hernia repair, placement of SurgiMend and omentectomy.
Sternal plate removal.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 27218**] is a 72 y.o. male with PMH significant for CAD s/p
CABG ([**2131-5-4**]), COPD, HTN who presents with recurrent ventral
hernia.

Approximately three years ago ([**2131-5-18**]), the patient had a
sternal repair done with plates. He had an omental transfer and
at that time a ventral hernia repair to the anterior fascia at
the bottom of sternotomy lead to a hernia. This was actually
repaired primarily and reinforced with mesh. A separate new hole
was made through the diaphragm for the omental transfer. Over
time omentum and bowel has protruded up through this hole in the
diaphragm, as evidenced on a recent CT. He now comes in for
repair of this defect. In addition was planning on removal of
his plates as he was having some discomfort. He understood we
could not guarantee success and further intervention may be
required.

Blood and sputum cx - No Growth to date.

ECG ([**2134-5-11**]) - Sinus rhythm. Normal tracing. Since the previous
tracing of [**2134-5-4**] sinus bradycardia is absent.

CXR ([**2134-5-11**]) - Mild bibasilar atelectasis documented on the CTA
performed subsequently, 8:00 a.m. on [**5-12**] and available at the
time of this dictation, in combination with pulmonary embolism
demonstrated on that study is sufficient to explain hypoxia.
There is no pulmonary edema. Heart size is probably normal and
unchanged. There is no pulmonary edema. Left pleural thickening
is chronic.

Echo ([**2134-5-12**]) - The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no
ventricular septal defect. RV appears to have normal free wall
contractility (poor image quality). There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid
regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-5-19**],
the RV funciton has probably improved. If indicated, a cardiac
MRI may better assess RV size and systolic function.

CXR ([**2134-5-12**]) - IMPRESSION: Asymmetric pulmonary edema, new since
one day prior.

CTA Chest ([**2134-5-12**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. Left upper lobe lobar pulmonary embolism.
2. Partial right lower lobe collapse due to a combination of
dependent secretions and bronchial wall thickening, with
associated surrounding peribronchial lymph nodes which are
probably reactive; however, a followup CT is recommended in four
to six weeks to ensure resolution.
3. Diffuse ground-glass opacities superimposed on centrilobular
emphysema are most likely infectious (such as viral in origin);
aspiration and asymetrical edema are less likely.
4. Large fatty lesion posterior to the left scapula contains
internal septations; considering large size and septations, a
dedicated MRI with contrast is recommended for further
evaluation to help distinguish a lipoma from a low grade
liposarcoma.
5. New ventral hernia mesh with postoperative changes in the
soft tissues of the anterior chest and upper abdomen.
6. Diffuse coronary artery calcification with CABG.

Bilateral LENIs ([**2134-5-13**]) - IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT of
bilateral lower extremities.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was taken to the operating room for a joint
procedure between Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of plastic surgery and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
of general surgery.  He [**Last Name (STitle) 1834**] the following procedures:
(1) Repair of chest wall hernia (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
(2) Ventral hernia repair, placement of SurgiMend and
omentectomy. Sternal plate removal (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to
the floor for routine post operate care.  He initially had poor
pain control and his PCA was titrated up.  He was kept strictly
NPO until return of bowel function.  Unfortunately, he developed
acute respiratory distress during the early morning hours of
[**2134-5-12**] that necessitated transfer to the medical intensive care
unit.
.
# Pulmonary: On POD 2, the patient was transferred to the ICU
for ongoing respiratory distress and hypoxia. He had been on 4L
NC since he was in the OR; however, he desaturated to the high
80's. Also, he had had ongoing difficulty with deep breaths
secondary to abdominal pain. CTA during this decompensation
showed pulmonary embolism. Imaging was also concerning for
underlying pneumonia as well as fluid overload. Shortly after
transfer to the ICU, the patient was noted to have worsening
hypercarbic respiratory failure and depressed mental status.
Ultimately, he was intubated on [**2134-5-12**]. The patient was started
on antibiotics to cover for his pneumonia (see below). Diuresis
was intially limited [**2-9**] hypotension; however, his blood
pressures improved and he was ultimately diuresed. After a few
days of antibiotics and diuresis, the patient's respiratory
status improved. His sedating medications were weaned and he was
ultimately extubated on [**2134-5-15**]. He was called out to the floor
on the day following his extubation and remained stable from a
pulmonary standpoint.
.
During the initial workup of his respiratory distress, a left
upper lobe lobar pulmonary embolism was noted on CTA. Of note,
patient does have a history of clots right femoral vein, left
IJ, superficial veins of the left and right cephalic veins,
superficial left basilic vein, and pulmonary embolism in setting
of surgery for cardiac tamponade s/p CABG [**5-14**]. Per Hematology
patient should have a minimum of 6 months of anticoagulation. In
2 months the patient will follow-up with hematology for
additional work-up and determination of total length of
anticoagulation. Mr. [**Known lastname 27218**] was initially on a conservative
heparin drip given he is recently post-operative. He was
continued on heparin until his INR was therapeutic.
.
He continued on oxygen via nasal cannula at a rate of 4 LPM for
the remainder of his admission and was maintaining an oxygen
saturation > 94%.  He continued pulmonary toilet with incentive
spirometry.  He responded well to intermittent doses of lasix
and was started on standing lasix 20mg by mouth daily.
.
Pneumonia - Patient with likely pneumonia based on imaging and
clinical history (reported approximately 1 week of cough during
the week prior to surgery). Large amount of secretions noted
during intubation. Pt started on levofloxacin on admission to
ICU. After intubation, ceftriaxone was added as double-coverage
to treat for severe CAP. Sputum and blood cx were sent but had
no growth to date at the time of transfer out of the ICU. On
transfer out of the ICU, the patient was continued on
levofloxacin / ceftriaxone with an end date of [**2134-5-21**].
.
# Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received Dilaudid via PCA
initially with poor pain control that was then transitioned to
PO dilaudid with good effect and adequate pain control.
.
# CV: Patient had troponin leak in setting pneumonia and
pulmonary embolism felt to be demand. The patient was evaluated
by the cardiology service during this admission.  They
recommended that the patient should discuss with his outpatient
cardiologist the utility of continuing plavix, given the
anticoagulation that will be started for his PE. Plavix was
restarted towards the end of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital admission.
.
Multiple EKGs were performed throughout this hospitalization
that did not detect any new ST or T wave abnormalities or any
other findings concerning for ischemia.
.
# GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until
tolerating oral intake. His diet was advanced when appropriate,
which was tolerated well. He was also started on a bowel regimen
to encourage bowel movement. Intake and output were
closely monitored, and urine output was noted to be marginal on
several occasions.  The patient initially received boluses of
IVF with improvement in his urine output.  After these boluses,
however, the patient was thought to be in fluid overload and
received lasix.  His urine output increased with lasix, as well.
.
The patient was continued on his home dose of finasteride for
his BPH.
.
ID: The patient was started on antibiotics for hospital acquired
pneumonia as above.
The patient's  temperature was closely watched for signs of
infection.
.
# Hematology: The patient's hematocrit did trend downwards
slightly after his transfer to the ICU. Hematocrit was followed
and remained stable thereafter. Of note, when patient was
intubated, OG tube was placed and moderate amount of brown
guaiac positive liquid was aspirated back; patient was kept on
heparin gtt and started on [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI.  When his plavix was
restarted, his PPI was transitioned to an H2 blocker due to the
interaction between these two medications.
.
# Musculoskeletal: The patient had difficulty ambulating and
getting out of bed.  This was thought to be due to
deconditioning.  A PT consult was requested and the patient
[**Hospital1 1834**] vigorous physical therapy.  He will require continued
physical therapy at rehab.
.
# Prophylaxis: The patient was maintained on subcutaneous
heparin after his operation.  He was transitioned to heparin
drip at the time of his pulmonary embolism, and eventually was
started on coumadin.  At the time of his discharge, his INR was
4.1 ([**2134-5-19**]).  His INR from [**2134-5-20**] was still pending.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: The left atrium is moderately dilated.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: The right atrium is mildly dilated.

LEFT VENTRICLE: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed. There is no resting left ventricular outflow
tract obstruction.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: The right ventricular wall thickness is normal. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears
depressed.

AORTA: The aortic root is normal in diameter. There are focal calcifications
in the aortic root.

stenotic.

MITRAL VALVE: The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. There is mild mitral annular calcification. There is
mild thickening of the mitral valve chordae. The tips of the papillary muscles
are calcified. There is no significant mitral stenosis. Mitral regurgitation
is present but cannot be quantified.

TRICUSPID VALVE: The tricuspid valve appears structurally normal with trivial
tricuspid regurgitation.

PERICARDIUM: There is no pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality due to poor echo windows.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed, global
(ejection fraction 20 percent). The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but not stenotic. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mitral regurgitation is present
but cannot be quantified. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2183-1-31**], no major change is evident, but the technically suboptimal nature of
both studies precludes certainty.

 PORTABLE CHEST:

 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Worsening shortness of breath and oxygen requirement.

 Comparison is made to prior chest radiographs of [**2183-2-4**] and [**8-21**], [**2183**].

 The heart is enlarged but stable in size.  There is persistent upper zone
 vascular redistribution and perihilar haziness.  Additionally, there is an
 area of increased opacity in the lingula which obscures the left heart border.
 Note is made of disruption and malalignment of the sternal wires which is
 unchanged dating back to [**2183-2-1**].

 IMPRESSION:
 1)  Confluent lingular opacity concerning for pneumonia.  When the patient's
 condition permits, more complete evaluation with standard PA and lateral chest
 radiographs is recommended.
 2)  Mild congestive heart failure pattern.
 3)  Malalignment and disruption of multiple sternal wires which appears to be
 chronic.  This may be due to a chronic sternal dehiscence.

Date of Birth:   [**2114-9-17**]     Sex:  M

Service:  C-MED Gold

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old
gentleman with a significant cardiac history with coronary
artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass graft),
hypertension, congestive heart failure, hyperlipidemia, and
diabetes mellitus who presented with worsening congestive
heart failure of several months in duration with new onset
chest pressure.

The patient was in his usual state of health until three days
prior to admission when he began to experience increasing
shortness of breath at rest and with exertion. However, the
patient was still able to walk his dog for approximately one
half of a mile per day.  No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  No
orthopnea.  Minimal bilateral lower extremity edema at
baseline.

The patient had one episode of [**5-10**] chest pressure (his
anginal equivalent) with exertion three days prior to
admission which resolved after one hour.

On the day prior to admission, the patient had a second
episode of [**10-10**] chest pressure, substernal, and without
radiation.  No associated nausea, vomiting, or palpitations.
Mild diaphoresis and lightheadedness.  The patient took one
sublingual nitroglycerin, and his pain score went down to
7/10, and he presented to the [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department for evaluation.

In the [**Hospital1 **] Emergency Department, the
patient's chest pressure was relieved with aspirin, heparin,
nitroglycerin, and Integrilin.  He also received metoprolol
intravenously.  He did continue to be short of breath despite
receiving 80 mg of Lasix intravenously on arrival.

The initial electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with a
left bundle-branch block and left atrial abnormality, without
any significant changed when compared to the previous tracing
of [**2183-2-22**].  His initial creatine kinase was 326
with a troponin T of 0.31.

Of note, the patient denies fevers or chills.  He has a
slight cough with sputum.  He is not on a low diet.  No
recent dietary indiscretion.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease.
(a)  Status post coronary artery bypass graft in [**2172**]; left
internal mammary artery to left anterior descending artery,
saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery, and saphenous
vein graft to diagonal.
(b)  Persantine MIBI on [**2183-2-4**] demonstrated a

and left ventricular hypokinesis with an ejection fraction of
21%.
2.  Congestive heart failure; [**State 531**] Heart Association
class II.  An echocardiogram on [**2183-1-31**] with
depressed left ventricular systolic function with an ejection
fraction of 20%.

11.  NPH insulin 95 units subcutaneously q.a.m. and 90 units
subcutaneously at dinner.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history was noncontributory for
coronary artery disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired painter.  He has
been married times 44 years.  He has a 60-pack-year history
of tobacco; he quit 15 years ago.  Occasional alcohol use.
No intravenous drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed his temperature was 98.4 degrees
Fahrenheit, blood pressure was 133/64, his heart rate was
107, his respiratory rate went from 40 to 24, and his oxygen
saturation was 95% on 2 liters.  In general, an elderly
gentleman in no apparent distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose,
and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.   Extraocular movements were intact.  The neck
was supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  No thyromegaly.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate.  Normal
first heart sounds and second heart sounds.  No murmurs,
rubs, clicks, or gallops.  Pulmonary examination revealed
decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.  No rales
or wheezes.  The abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  Normal active bowel sounds.  No
hepatosplenomegaly or masses.  Extremity examination revealed
2+ pitting edema bilaterally to the knees.  Neurologic
examination revealed alert and oriented times three.  Cranial
nerves II through XII were grossly intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Initial
laboratories revealed creatine kinase was 326, CK/MB was 14,
troponin T was 0.25, and MB index was 4.3.  His white blood
cell count was 7.8, his hematocrit was 33, and his platelets
were 281.  Sodium was 135, potassium was 4.2, chloride was
99, bicarbonate was 28, blood urea nitrogen was 24,
creatinine was 1.1, and blood glucose was 303.  Prothrombin
time was 13.8, partial thromboplastin time was 25.2, and his
INR was 1.3.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray demonstrated
cardiomegaly with pulmonary vasculature redistribution and a
new lingular opacity (pneumonia versus asymmetric pulmonary
edema), and a small calcified granuloma in the right upper
lobe (as previously demonstrated).

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The
patient was admitted to the C-MED Service, placed on
telemetry, and continued on his outpatient cardiac
medications, as well as a nitroglycerin, heparin, and
Integrilin drips.

1.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  At baseline, the
patient had been on 2 liters nasal cannula of home oxygen.
His oxygen requirement remained stable while in house on 3
liters nasal cannula.  He was saturating at 97%.

An echocardiogram was performed on [**2183-8-21**] which
demonstrated an ejection fraction of 20% with global
hypokinesis; consistent with prior examination.

The patient was continued on digoxin 0.25 mg by mouth once
per day and Lasix 80 mg intravenously once per day.  Daily
weights and strict ins-and-outs were monitored.  On the day
of discharge, the patient no longer had edema of the lower
extremities.  He was saturating at 100% on 2 liters with his
lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.

2.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient ruled in by
enzyme criteria; however, his electrocardiogram continued to
be unchanged with a left bundle-branch block at baseline.

There was consideration of catheterization during this
inpatient stay; however, given the patient's complications
with gastrointestinal bleeds, as well as his reluctance to
undergo this procedure, this was deferred.

The patient underwent a chemical stress MIBI on [**2183-8-26**]; during which time he had no anginal symptoms or
interpretable electrocardiogram changes.  By verbal report,
the nuclear portion of this study demonstrated fixed defects
in the anterior/inferior walls with an ejection fraction of
20% and left ventricular cavity enlargement.

3.  ANEMIA/GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED ISSUES:  The patient had an
episode of melena on the morning of [**2183-8-22**].  He
denied bright red blood per rectum, hematemesis,
coffee-grounds emesis, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
He had never had symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding in the
past.

A nasogastric lavage demonstrated no active upper
gastrointestinal bleed, and his vital signs remained stable
with a stable hematocrit at 29.8.  Two large-bore intravenous
lines were placed, and the patient was transfused a total of
three units of packed red blood cells with 80 mg of
intravenous Lasix prior to this transfusion.  He was also
started on Protonix 40 mg intravenously twice per day.  The
Integrilin, heparin, and aspirin were held.

A Gastroenterology consultation was obtained, and an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy was recommended and performed on
the morning of [**2183-8-23**].  This demonstrated gastritis.
Nevertheless, due to the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding
he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit because
of concern over the initial hematocrit drop from 33 to 26
with a question of potential retroperitoneal bleed.

On [**2183-8-22**], when he was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, an abdominal and pelvic computed
tomography without contrast was obtained which demonstrated
some cholelithiasis without evidence for cholecystitis, and
no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.

An anemia workup was continued, and iron studies demonstrated
an elevated ferritin and decreased total iron-binding
capacity suggesting likely anemia of chronic disease with
acute anemia secondary to gastritis superimposed.

The patient remained stable and was transferred back to the
C-MED Service on the evening of [**2183-8-23**].  For the
duration of his inpatient course, the patient's hematocrit
remained stable at 32.7, and he did not experience subsequent
episodes of melena or hematemesis.

Of note, the aspirin, heparin, and Integrilin continued to be
held (this contributed to the unwillingness to perform
cardiac catheterization during this inpatient stay).

4.  PNEUMONIA ISSUES:  On admission chest x-ray, the patient
was noted to have a lingular infiltrate that was felt to be
new compared to prior studies.  Of note, the patient's white
blood cell count was 7.8, but he did spike to 102.3 degrees
Fahrenheit on [**2183-8-22**].  Thus, it was felt that the
chest x-ray infiltrate was consistent with pneumonia, and he
was started on levofloxacin 500 mg once per day for a 10-day
course.

The patient's chest x-ray gradually improved during his
inpatient stay.  On the day of discharge, his temperature was
99.6 with a white blood cell count of 13.3.  Of note, his
maximum white blood cell count had been 13.9.  The patient
had been afebrile for 48 hours prior to discharge.

5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on an
insulin sliding-scale with four times per day fingersticks.
His glucose remained within normal limits during this
hospital course.

6.  MENTAL STATUS CHANGE ISSUES:  The patient was minimally
agitated during his Medical Intensive Care Unit stay.  It was
felt that this was likely baseline dementia with superimposed
Intensive Care Unit delirium.  He did have a recent head
computed tomography which showed no acute event.

Of note, his mental status was much improved upon transfer to
the floor.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:   The patient was discharged on [**2183-8-26**].  His vital signs were stable.  He was saturating at
100% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  His creatine kinase levels
had been dropping from 187 to 108 with a troponin of 0.31.
He was asymptomatic.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Acute non-ST-segment myocardial infarction.
2.  Pneumonia.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Gastrointestinal bleed.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lipitor 20 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Celexa 20 mg by mouth by mouth twice per day.
3.  Doxazosin 2-mg tablets one tablet by mouth once per day.
4.  Timolol eyedrops 0.25% one both eyes q.a.m.
5.  Levofloxacin 500-mg tablets one tablet by mouth once per
day (for a 10-day course with day one being on [**2183-8-22**]).
6.  Lisinopril 40 mg by mouth once per day.

 HISTORY:  Sixty-eight year old man with NSTE MI, rising Troponin, s/p CABG, low
 EF, hematocrit drop.

 SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB:
 Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142
 mg/kg/min. Two minutes after the cessation of infusion, Tc-[**Age over 90 26**]m sestamibi was
 administered IV.

 INTERPRETATION:
 Image Protocol: Gated SPECT.
 Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium-201.
 Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.

 Stress images show moderate left ventricular enlargement which does not change
 during resting perfusion images.

 Stress images show a moderate perfusion defect in the anterior wall which is
 unchanged in resting perfusion images.  Stress images show a moderate perfusion
 defect in the inferior wall which does not change in the resting perfusion
 images.  Stress images show a mild perfusion defect in the septum which is also
 unchanged on the resting perfusion images.

 Ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after
 Dipyridamole administration is 19%.  There is global hypokinesis.

 Compared to prior study from [**2183-2-4**], the partial reversibility on the moderate

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  75-year-old male with coronary disease status post CABG admitted
 with orchitis.

 COMPARISONS:  No comparisons are available.

 TECHNIQUE:  8 - MDCT axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained
 without IV contrast.  IV contrast was not administered because the patient's
 creatinine was 2.6.  Oral contrast was not administered.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is cardiomegaly and severe
 coronary artery calcifications.  There are no pleural effusions.  There are no
 pericardial effusions.  There are patchy opacities in bilateral lung bases
 which could represent atelectasis.

 There is a hypodense area in the dome of the liver measuring 10 mm (series 2,
 image 8).  This was not well characterized in the study.  There was another
 hyperdense area on lobe of the liver (series 2, image 24) measuring 4 mm. This
 was also too small to characterize.  The gallbladder is not distended. The
 spleen is unremarkable.

 Both adrenal glands are enlarged and slightly nodular.  Differential diagnosis
 would include adenomas versus hyperplasia.  There is no evidence of
 hydronephrosis.  There are calcifications of renal artery branches.  There is
 a small hypodense area in the mid pole of the right kidney measuring 6 mm that
 is too small to characterize in this study.  Hyperdense exophytic area of the
 lower pole of the left kidney was not well characterized in this study.
 Although it could represent a hyperdense cyst, possibility of a small mass
 cannot be excluded.  Recommend ultrasound of the kidney or MRI for further
 evaluation.

 The pancreas is unremarkable.  There is no intra or extrahepatic bile duct
 dilatation.  There is no pancreatic duct dilatation.  The small and large
 bowels are within normal limits.  The aorta is severely calcified.  There is
                                                             (Over)

 dilatation of the right common iliac artery, which measures up to 2 cm.  There
 is also aneurysmal dilatation of the right common femoral artery, which
 measures up to 2 cm. There is no free fluid or free air in the abdomen.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is a Foley catheter within the
 urinary bladder.  The scrotum is markedly enlarged and there is a large amount
 of air within the scrotum with tracks up to the left inguinal canal.  The air
 in the scrotal sac predominates in the left side.  There is also stranding and
 edema.  These findings are consistent with a Fournier gangrene.  Findings were
 immediately communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59535**].

 BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

 Multiplanar reconstructions, were important to evaluate the extent of the air.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Findings consistent with Fournier gangrene involving predominantly the
 left aspect of the scrotum.  It tracks up through the left inguinal canal.
 Findings were immediately communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59535**] at 10:20 p.m.
 2.  Ectasia of the right common iliac artery measuring up to 2 cm.
 3.  Right femoral artery aneurysm measuring 2 cm.
 4.  Severe coronary artery calcifications and cardiomegaly.
 5.  Small hypodense areas in the liver and kidneys are not well characterized
 in this noncontrast study.
 6.  Exophytic hyperdense area in the lower pole of left kidney requires
 further workup with ultrasound or MRI.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to chest radiographs since [**8-10**], most recently

 Endotracheal tube, new left subclavian line and new right subclavian Swan-Ganz
 line are in standard placements.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  There is no new mediastinal
 widening.

 A new subpleural opacity in the right mid lung marginated by the minor fissure
 and a triangular opacity at the base of the left lung projecting over the
 cardiac silhouette are concerning for pulmonary infarctions.  Pulmonary
 vascular engorgement has progressed slightly but there is no pulmonary edema
 or appreciable pleural effusion.

 Reason: Eval new bil infiltrates.
 Admitting Diagnosis: ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION-SEPSIS
 ______________________________________________________________________________
 [**Hospital 2**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
      75 year old man with AS, MR and new onset CP, now s/p scrotal debridement.

 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
  Eval new bil infiltrates.
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  75-year-old man status post scrotal debridement, now with chest
 pain, evaluate infiltrate.

 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated [**2166-8-11**].

 AP PORTABLE SUPINE, SINGLE VIEW:  The ET tube is in appropriate position at
 the thoracic inlet.  The feeding tube is coiled in the stomach with its tip in
 the fundus.  The left subclavian venous line has its tip at the junction of
 the left innominate vein with the superior vena cava.  The Swan-Ganz catheter
 has been slightly advanced, with its tip now terminating in the right
 interlobar pulmonary artery.  There is cardiomegaly, which is unchanged since
 the prior exam.  Again seen are median sternotomy wires.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.  In the lungs, there is progressive perihilar haziness, with
 associated peribronchial cuffing.  This is consistent with a slight
 progression of pulmonary edema.  Additionally, there is a linear retrocardiac
 opacity, which likely represents atelectasis in the left lower lobe.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Perihilar haziness and peribronchial cuffing, suggestive of progressing
 pulmonary edema.
 2.  Retrocardiac linear opacity, which likely represents atelectasis in the
 left lower lobe.

 HISTORY:  Central line placement.

 FINDINGS:  The Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed.  There are bilateral
 subclavian lines with tip in the superior vena cava.  The heart continues to
 be moderately enlarged with increased retrocardiac opacity consistent with
 volume loss/infiltrate.  Mediastinal drains have been removed.  The NG tube
 tip is coiled in the stomach.  The ET tube is 5.5 cm above the carina.  The
 study is slightly limited by motion.  There is a probable small right effusion
 and some mild pulmonary vascular redistribution suggesting fluid overload.

  No intraabdominal or pelvic abscess.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 MULTIDETECTOR CT SCAN OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH ORAL AND INTRAVENOUS
 CONTRAST (CT ENTEROGRAPHY PROTOCOL).

 Multiplanar reconstructions in the sagittal and coronal plane are also
 included.

 CLINICAL DETAILS:  Recent PEG tube placement.  Abdominal pain, evaluate for
 abscess.

 CT SCAN OF ABDOMEN WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST:  The heart size is enlarged,
 three-vessel coronary artery calcification is noted.  Patient has had a
 previous sternotomy.

 Minimal rim of fluid at both lung bases.  Minor patchy consolidation at the
 posterior aspect of the left lower lobe.Some consolidation in the dependent
 portion of the right lower lobe.

 A  5 to 6mm uncalcified nodule in the anterolateral aspect of the left lower
 lobe (series 2, image 9) could represent an uncalcified granuloma.  If there
 is no background concerning clinical history, interval followup in a year
 could be considered to ensure stability.

 Nasogastric tube tip lies in the gastric fundus.

 The percutaneous gastrostomy tube lies in the gastric body.  There is no
 adjacent or other intraabdominal collection, free fluid, or air.

 The liver is normal in size.  There is a subcentimeter fluid-attenuating cyst
 in the dome of segment 8 of the liver (series 2, image 11) and a nonspecific 5
 mm area of nodular hyperattenuation more laterally at the dome (series 2,

 image 12).  The spleen, gallbladder, pancreas are normal.  The adrenal glands
 are slightly prominent in size but no lesions demonstrated.

 Both kidneys are normal in size.  Small number of subcentimeter well rounded
 cortical hypodensities are too small to characterize.  6-mm exophytic
 posterior to the left lower pole cortex was hyperdense in the preceding non-
 contrast CT.  It does not show post-contrast enhancement and most probably
 represents a hyperdense cyst, this could be followed up with interval
 ultrasound in 6 months to further characterize/ensure stability.

 Generalized atheromatous calcification of the abdominal aorta and iliac
 vasculature, the abdominal aorta is normal in caliber.

 CT SCAN OF PELVIS WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST:  Moderate diverticulosis of the
 lower left and upper sigmoid colon.

 The prostate gland is normal in size, urinary catheter within the bladder,
 which is empty at time of scanning.

 Focal ectasia of the distal right common femoral artery measuring up to 2.4 cm
 AP x 2.3 cm transverse with generalized atherosclerotic calcification.  The
 inferiormost images show the superior extent of recent skin incision in medial
 left groin.

 No concerning bone lesions demonstrated on bone window settings.  There is at
 least a 25% collapse of the superior endplate of the T8 vertebral body.  The
 remainder of the vertebral body heights in the lower thoracic and lumber spine
 are intact.

 Probable incidental hemangioma noted in the T10 vertebral body.

 CONCLUSION:

 1.  No intraabdominal or pelvic abscess or free fluid demonstrated.  The PEG
 tube lies in the gastric body.

 2.  Patchy consolidation in the dependent portions of both lower lobes more
 marked on the right side.

 3.  5 to 6mm uncalcified nodule in the inferolateral aspect of the left lower
 lobe as described.  If there is no concerning background clinical history then
 interval followup in one year as advised to ensure stability.

Service: UROLOGY

Allergies:
Inderal / Bactrim / Codeine / Penicillins

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6157**]
Chief Complaint:
epididymitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
incision and drainage of Fournier's gangrene

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 75 year old male who was transferred from an
outside hospital because of a suspected myocardial infarction on
[**2166-8-10**] and possible need for cardiac catheterization.  He was
admitted to the cardiology service initially.  His symproms
actually began six days prior to admission with flu-like
symptoms.  Then five days prior to admission, the patient began
complaining of a painful lump in his left testicle.  His
symptoms gradually worsened, with increasing pain, erythema, and
edema of his left testicle.  In addition, he complained of
difficulty urinating for two days prior to admission.  He was
admitted to an outside hospital four days prior to admission
here, at which time a Foley catheter was placed and he was
started on IV Levofloxacin and Clindamycin (which was switched
to Levofloxacin and Vancomycin the following day) for
epididymitis diagnosed by ultrasound.  The ultrasound also
showed questionable air in the scrotum.  The patient was seen by
a urologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], as well as an infectious disease
specialist.  He denied any trauma to his scrotum.  He has no
significant urologic history.  His prostate examination revealed
a 20 to 25 gram nonfluctuent prostate.  He is not diabetic and
he is not immunocompromised.  He reported that his pain has been
improving on the antibiotics.  However, on the night prior to
admission he developed acute pulmonary edema, shortness of
breath, hypotension and EKG changes suggestive of myocardial
infarction (ST elevation in leads V1-[**Street Address(2) 23394**] depression in
V5-6).  His peak troponin was 0.96.  Neo-synepherine was started
upon admission because of hypotension, which was presumed to be
secondary to sepsis.  Significant cardiac history includes a
CABG in [**2141**], hypertension, aortic stenosis, mitral
regurgitation, high cholesterol, and congestive heart failure
(EF of 40%).  Upon re-evaluation at this hospital, his EKG
changes were thought to be secondary to demand ischemia, rather
than a myocardial infarction.  In addition, the patient was
noted to be in acute renal failure, with a createnine of 1.8 on
admission, likely due to prerenal causes.  Blood and urine
cultures from the outside hospital were all negative.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the cardiology service at [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2166-8-10**] for presumed myocardial infarction on electrocardiogram,
which was later attributed to demand ischemia due to sepsis.  He
was initially started on neo-synephrine for hypotension.  He was
continued on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin for his epididymitis.
The urology team saw and evaluated the patient as a consult
service under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4229**].  Our suspicion of Fournier's gangrene
at that time was very low, considering his lack of risk factors
and lack of significant groin erythema, however a CT scan of his
abdomen and pelvis was ordered to rule out Fournier's.  That CT
scan confirmed the diagnosis of Fournier's gangrene on the
morning of hospital day two (tracking of air around his left
hemi scrotum tracking up the left spermatic cord.  At that time,
the patient was emergently rushed to the operating room for
emergent surgical debridement by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4229**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], chief
urology resident.  During the operation, the patient had the
majority of his left scrotum and all of his left testicle
removed.  He was then admitted to the trauma intensive care
unit.  He was sedated on Propofol with Fentanyl for pain.  He
was started on a Levophed drip to maintain blood pressure.  A
central venous line was placed, as well as a Swann Ganz
catheter.  An oro-gastric tube was placed and put to gravity.
His Foley was continued from the operating room.  Dressing
changes to his scrotum were scheduled for three times per day.
On postoperative day two, his maximum temperature was 101.0.
His Levophed drip was weaned to a low level. Tube feeds were
started through his NG tube.  On postoperative day three, the
plastic surgery service began their evaluation of the patient
for future closure of his wound.  His propofol was discontinued.
 His Levophed was discontinued.  He vomited twice and his tube
feeds were held for high residuals.  He recieved one unit of red
blood cells for a hematocrit under 30, and his hematocrit
responded well.  His acute renal appeared to have resolved, as
his createnine dropped down to 1.0.  On postoperative day four,
his ventillator was weaned to pressure support, however he had
some apneic spells.  A HIT panel was negative and his
subcutaneous heparin was restarted.  He had some bedside
debridement by the urology team and his wound looked like it was
healing well.  He was transfused with another unit of red blood
cells.  The patient was noted to be roughly twenty liters
positive and diuresis with a Lasix drip was started as
tolerated.  On postoperative day seven, the patient required
some propofol for sedation due to endotracheal tube and
oro-gastric tube irritation.  A sputum culture came back
positive for MRSA sensative to Vancomycin.  His wound cultures
were positive for mixed flora including Bacteroides, Provatella,
and coagulase negative Staphylococcus.  A wound VAC was placed
by urology.  On postoperative day eight, a post-pyloric feeding
tube was placed by interventional radiology because the patient
was not tolerating tube feeds via the oro-gastric tube.  On
postoperative day nine, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4229**] agreed to allow placement of a
tracheostomy tube and a PEG tube at a later date.  The patient
had been unable to tolerate a ventillator wean up to this point,
most likely due to his fluid overload and his cardiac history.
Tube feeds were running at agoal of 90ml/ hour.  On
postoperative day ten, his Flagyl and Levofloxacin were
discontinued.  He was transfused one unit of blood for a
hematocrit less than thirty.  On postoperative day twelve, he
recieved another unit of red blood cells.

On POD 14, a #8 percutaneous trach was placed at the bedside.  A
perc PEG was placed uner direct visualization, but the tube was
pulled through the abdominal wall.  The patient was subsequently
taken to the OR for an open gastrostomy tube which was placed
without further complication.  Vancomycin was stopped on [**8-25**]
after a complete 14-day course.  On [**2166-8-27**], the wound was
closed primarily at the bedside by the plastic surgery service.
TF were restarted on [**2166-8-27**] and advanced as tolerated.  A PICC
line was also placed on [**2166-8-27**].  Propofol was d/c'd on [**2166-8-28**].
 ON [**2166-8-28**], the patient spiked a temp to 102.  Cultures were
drawn and the A-line tip sent for culture as well.  [**2166-8-29**] tube
feeds were held for high residuals, an ileus was found on
imaginig.  PT evaluation occured on [**2166-8-29**].  Trach mask trials
were started on [**2166-8-28**] and the vent weaned as tolerated, with
the patient still requring vent assistance most of the day.
Vancomycin was restarted on [**2166-8-30**] for MRSA sputum; it will be
continued for 7 days; the JP drain was removed on this day as
well.  TF were restarted on [**2166-9-1**] and brought to goal over the
next day.  The patient is now tolerating TF at goal with bowel
movements.

On [**2166-9-3**], the patient was tolerating TF at goal, having bowel
movements, tolerating trach mask trials daily, was working with
PT, had good pain control with roxicet elixer, was alert and
requring no sedation.  He was subsequently transfered to rehab
for physical therapy and vent weaning.

 INDICATION:  History of brainstem lesion on outside MR.

 COMPARISON:  Outside MR not available for comparison.

 TECHNIQUE:  Post-contrast multiplanar T1 MR imaging including a multiplanar
 RAGE imaging was performed.

 FINDINGS:  No focal enhancing lesions are demonstrated.  However, the pons is
 uniformly enlarged, with mass effect causing compression of the fourth
 ventricle. Otherwise, the study is unremarkable, without abnormal signal
 demonstrated in the brain parenchyma. The ventricles are normal in size
 without evidence for hydrocephalus.  There is no evidence for brainstem
 herniation.

 IMPRESSION:  Expandedpons with mass effect upon the fourth ventricle.  No
 focal enhancing lesion is identified.  Findings are concerning for low-grade
 pontine glioma, admittedly an unusual diagnosis in an adult patient.

 HISTORY:  56-year-old man status post stereotactic biopsy of the pons.

 Evaluate for bleed.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.

 FINDINGS:  Again, there is an enlarged pons noted.  There is a tiny bubble of
 gas within the right side of the pons, presumably at the post-biopsy site.
 There is right-sided pneumocephaly.  Small amount of air is noted within the
 frontal [**Doctor Last Name 218**] of the right lateral ventricle.  There is no evidence of an
 intracranial hemorrhage.  There is no shift of the normally midline
 structures.  The [**Doctor Last Name 37**]-white matter differentiation seems grossly preserved,
 with no evidence of acute infarct.  The pons is noted to be enlarged as before
 causing mass effect upon the fourth ventricle.  There is no hydrocephalus.

 IMPRESSION:  Status post biopsy with no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
 Pneumocephaly and gas is at presumed biopsy site within the right side of the
 pons.

 INDICATION:  History of colon cancer and testicular cancer, with pons glioma,
 which significant hilar lymphadenopathy.  Evaluate pulmonary pathology
 further, which was seen on prior chest x-ray.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to
 the lung bases.

 CONTRAST:  100 cc of IV Optiray contrast were administered due to the rapid
 rate of bolus injection required for this study.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are several small mediastinal lymph
 nodes in the right paratracheal and precarinal position which are not enlarged
 by CT criteria.  There is a small right perihilar lymph node also noted.  No
 axillary lymphadenopathy is seen.  The heart and pericardium are normal in
 appearance.  The great vessels are normal in appearance.  The patient is
 intubated, and an ET tube is seen within the superior portion of the trachea.
 A tiny hypodensity is seen within the left lobe of the thyroid gland.

 Within the left lower lobe, there is a consolidative opacity, with central
 area of necrosis, an air-fluid level, and low-attenuation material.
 Additionally, there are several areas within the right and left lungs
 peripherally, with patchy opacity and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 2085**] opacities, concerning for
 multifocal opacity.  There is also a wedge-shaped opacity in the right lower
 lung zone, some of which may represent atelectasis.

 There is a 3.3 x 2.6 cm nodule with multiple foci of calcification within
 the left lower lobe.

 Within limited images of the superior portions of the liver, spleen, kidneys,
 adrenal glands, stomach, and pancreas, no definite abnormalities are
 identified.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  There is opacity at the left lung base, which is wedge shaped, and
 contains an area of fluid and air suggesting necrotizing pneumonia.

 2.  There is a 3.3 x 2.6 cm nodule within the left lower lobe, which
 demonstrates multiple foci of coarse calcifications.  This may represent
 calcification of a benign lesion such as a hamartoma; however, in the setting
 of colon cancer, a metastatic focus from a primary colonic malignancy cannot
 be entirely excluded.
 3.  A tiny hypodense nodule is seen within the left lobe of the thyroid.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATIONS:  56-year-old man with a history of colon and testicular cancer,
 now with a pons glioma.  He has significant hilar lymphadenopathy and
 pulmonary pathology.  Rule out pulmonary embolism.

 COMPARISONS:  [**2133-1-3**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial noncontrast CT images with a low dose were obtained of the
 chest, and subsequent axial CT imaging of the chest with intravenous contrast
 was then performed.  Sagittal and coronal reconstructions were also performed.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH AND WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The patient has been extubated.
 Again noted are multiple small, but slightly prominent, mediastinal lymph
 nodes with an overall similar appearance. The appearance of small right hilar
 nodes is also unchanged.

 There is no evidence of pulmonary embolism. The heart, great vessels, and
 pericardium are unremarkable.

 There is a new small cavitary lesion of 9 mm in diameter in the left upper
 lobe, possibly related to aspiration. Again noted is a large calcified mass in
 the lingula of 37 mm in diameter, similar in size and appearance.

 The appearance of the consolidation in the left lower lobe is more patchy, and
 less confluent than before, with interval improvement. Within this region,
 there is a persistent cavitating mass with an air-fluid level, which measures
 41 cm in diameter. An area of loculated fluid posterior to the lesion measures
 19 mm in diameter but is somewhat smaller than before. The consolidation in
 the right lung lower lobe persists but is likewise slightly improved. Mucus is
 present in the upper trachea, but the major airways appear patent.

 Multiple areas of faint ground-glass opacity in the right upper lobe have
 mostly resolved since the prior study. A residual nodule of 5 mm remains in
 the right upper lobe. There is a persistent small left pleural effusion.

 There is a small hiatal hernia. There is a nasogastric tube coursing into the
 stomach, its inferior course not fully evaluated here.

 BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

 1.  Some improvement in the consolidation in the left lower lobe, although the
 large 4-cm cavitary lesion with an air-fluid level persists, consistent with
 slight overall improvement in necrotizing pneumonia.

 2.  New small cavitary lesion in the left upper lobe, possibly related to
 aspiration. Of note, the patient has a small hiatal hernia.

 3.  Improvement in some of the ground-glass opacities in the right middle and
 upper lobes, with persistent 4-mm lung nodule.

 5.  Similar slightly prominent right hilar and mediastinal lymph nodes.

 6.  No evidence of pulmonary embolism.

 7.  Similar calcified lung mass, possibly a hamartoma, although metastatic
 colon cancer cannot be excluded.

 CT-GUIDED ABSCESS DRAINAGE

 There is a comparison study from [**2133-1-9**].

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  Lung abscess, evaluate for drainage.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images of the thorax were obtained prior to procedure.
 Images demonstrate a cavitary lesion in the left lower lobe which contains
 minimal amount of fluid.  The cavity has decreased in size since the prior
 exam of [**2133-1-9**] when it had measured 4.8 x 3.4 cm, currently it measures 3.3 x
 2.5 cm.  Changes consistent with emphysema are present.  Scattered nodules are
 present as well.  A large partially calcified mass is present in the lingula
 measuring 3.5 x 2.9 cm.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  The tip of a central
 catheter is present in the SVC.  Bone windows demonstrate no lytic or blastic
 lesions.  A smaller cavity is present in the apical segment of the left lower
 lobe, at this location previously there was consolidation, and this area of
 consolidation is cavitated.

 The advantages and complications of the procedure were explained to the
 patient.  The patient gave written informed consent.  The skin over the left
 hemithorax was prepped and draped in usual sterile fashion.  1% lidocaine was
 administered locally.  Since the fluid was no longer present in the cavity and
 the cavity has decreased in size, a decision was made not to insert a drainage
 catheter.  Instead 5 cc of saline were instilled into the cavity and
 aspirated.  This was repeated two times.  A 20-gauge Franseen needle was used
 for the procedure.  Patient tolerated the procedure satisfactorily.  Dr.
 [**First Name (STitle) 2953**] was present throughout the entire procedure.

 Post-procedure images demonstrate a small left-sided pneumothorax.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Successful aspiration of a left lower lobe cavity.  The aspirated material
 was sent to the laboratory for the requested analyses.
 2.  Small left pneumothorax.

 HISTORY:  Pontine glioma, necrotizing pneumonia.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial images through the chest, abdomen and pelvis with oral and
 IV contrast.

 COMPARISON:  [**2133-1-16**].

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH CONTRAST:  There are small pretracheal and AP window
 lymph nodes, none meeting CT criteria for pathology.  There are no
 pathologically enlarged axillary, hilar, or mediastinal lymph nodes.  A right
 subclavian catheter terminates in the distal superior vena cava.  There is a
 stable 5 mm right upper lobe nodule.  There is a stable 1 cm right lower lobe
 pulmonary nodule.  There is a patchy opacity adjacent to the right major
 fissure in the right upper lobe.  There is a 4 mm nodule in the left upper
 lobe which appears smaller in size.  There are more innumerable scattered
 areas of nodularity throughout all lung fields, left greater than right. There
 is a stable calcified mass in the lingula measuring 3.5 x 2.7 cm, not
 particularly changed.  The cavitary lesion in the left lower lobe has
 decreased in size, with the cavity now measuring approximately 1.5 x 1 cm.
 There are bilateral emphysematous changes.  There is bibasilar atelectasis.
 There is also collapse/consolidation within the left lower lobe, increased
 from the prior study, and could be partially obscuring a more nodular area
 seen within the left lower lobe previously.  No other definite cavitary
 lesions are seen.

 There is no pneumothorax.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST:  The scan is performed in a late phase, with
 much of the contrast within the renal collecting system.  Given this, the
 liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands, pancreas, kidneys, and ureters are
 normal.  The large and small bowel are unremarkable.  There are no
 pathologically enlarged mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymph nodes.  There is
 no free air or free fluid.  There are no abscesses.  The appendix is normal.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH CONTRAST:  The bladder contains air, presumably related
 to a recent instrumentation, although a Foley catheter is not present.  The
 rectum and sigmoid colon are normal.  The prostate contains a calcification.
 There is no lymphadenopathy or free fluid.

Service: MEDICINE

Allergies:
Patient recorded as having No Known Allergies to Drugs

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2186**]
Chief Complaint:
Progressive signs of dizziness, visual difficulties, unsteady
gait

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Right-sided high frontal stereotactic biopsy, CT-guided target
point, definition and MRI-guided intraoperative imaging.


History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 56-year-old male with a history of colon
cancer, as well as testicular cancer, who presents with
progressive signs of dizziness, visual difficulties, unsteady
gait for approximately 12 months. He was worked up including an
MRI scan that showed a brainstem lesion. He was referred to the
brain tumor clinic for consideration of a biopsy.

The patient has been followed at the [**Hospital6 **] at [**Location 10050**]. He had been treated for a number of medical issues. He
was examined by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 66170**] whose physical exam reportedly
showed bilateral facial numbness and swaying, and a MRI of the
head was preformed. This demonstrated expansion of the
brainstem without significant contrast enhancement. The patient
was thus considered to have a brainstem glioma and started on
Decadron. The patient now presents for a surgical opinion. In
the office, the patient complains about dizziness, blurred
vision, double vision, occasional headaches, and unsteady gait.
He feels better with medications. He takes at baseline 2 Tylenol
a day. Has a history of arthritis in the lower back, otherwise,
he reports that the numbness in his hands has disappeared since
starting the Decadron. The patient has tapered his Decadron to a
dose of 2 mg p.o. b.i.d. The patient is otherwise feeling
himself stable. He was told that he had a left lazy eye at
baseline, but the patient is not quite sure about the symptoms.
He denies otherwise any extreme fatigue, weight loss or other
symptoms.


Past Medical History:
Hypertension
Hypercholesterolemia
Sigmoid colon cancer [**2125**]
Testicular cancer s/p Left orchiectomy and was found to be a
germ cell tumor T1, N0.was treated with adjuvant chemotherapy no
radiation.
Hemorrhoids
Recurrent bouts of thrush


Social History:
He is a high school graduate. He is an electrician. He is
divorced. He has no other people in the household. He has a
40-pack-year history of smoking. He drinks about three drinks a
week, and he denies any recreational drug use.



Family History:
His mother died at 63 of a heart attack. His father died at 44
after a MVA. He has two sisters 58 and 54, the 54-year-old has
gallbladder stones. Other than that, they both are healthy.
There are two brothers, one brother at 47 who has
hypertension and two daughters that are in good health.


Physical Exam:
GENERAL: He is alert, pleasant, middle-aged man in no acute
distress. Weight was 170 pounds, height was 74 inches, blood
pressure was 154/90, pulse of 96, respirations 20, temperature
of 97.4.

HEENT: The patient did have a head tilt to the left.
CARDIOVASCULAR: Regular rate and rhythm. No murmurs, gallops or
rubs.
LUNGS: Clear to auscultation.
EXTREMITIES: No clubbing, cyanosis or edema.

NEUROLOGIC: The patient is awake, alert and oriented. He has
bilateral reactive pupils. Eye movements are full and we cannot
detect a clear deficit of a particular muscle, at current, the
patient has no diplopia. Visual fields seem to be fully intact.
He has non-exhaustible end gaze nystagmus with rotatory
component. Face is symmetric. Tongue is midline. No
fasciculations. He has a hoarse voice. He has full strength
bilaterally. He has intact sensation and symmetric reflexes. The
patient does not have any memory problems, blackouts, nausea,
concentration, or speech problems, as well as hearing problems.
On motor examination, he was [**4-24**] bilaterally, normal tone, no
drift. I found no evidence of any weakness in his hands. Upper

Pathology [**2132-12-31**]:
MIDDLE CEREBELLAR PEDUNCLE/PONS STEREOTACTIC BRAIN BIOPSY
(including intraoperative smear):
DIFFUSELY INFILTRATING FIBRILLARY ASTROCYTOMA. WHO ([**2126**]) grade
II out of IV.
.


Brief Hospital Course:
56 M with PMH sigmoid and testicular ca in [**2125**], HTN, COPD,
admitted for new diagnosis pontine glioma s/p posterior fossa
decompression and necrotizing pna.
.
# Pontine glioma:
56 year-old man initially seen and discussed in brain tumor
clinic. Patient taken to OR on [**12-31**] for brainstem lesion biopsy
under general anesthesia. Postoperatively stayed in the PACU 6
hours then transferred to floor. On postop day one patient
demonstrated difficulty of swallowing which he failed his speech
and swallow evaluation. Patient kept NPO, started IV fluids. On
[**2133-1-2**] patient taken back to OR for a suboccipital chiari
decompression. Patient tranferred to neuro ICU for hemodymanic
and neurologic monitoring. Due to postoperaive respiratory
secretion extubated on [**2133-1-4**] after bronchcospy.
.
Brain stem biopsy pathology result is significant for
infiltrative astrocytoma. Radiation oncology decided not to
perform radiation mapping and to hold off for another several
weeks before planning to start XRT, since patient has a slow
growing glioma, and XRT could exacerbate pna.  Patient known by
Dr [**Last Name (STitle) 4253**] will follow up with him as scheduled.  Patient was
transferred to Step-down unit on [**2132-1-7**].  His speech continued
to become more articulate and clear, and his mental status
continued to become more clear.  The patient stated that his
dizziness has improved.
.
# Necrotizing pneumonia:
Patient has a known pulmonary process that been followed in
[**Hospital 669**] [**Hospital **] hospital in MA. In house repeat CT of the chest
significant for left lower lobe, consolidative opacity, with
central area of necrosis, an air-fluid level, and
low-attenuation material. Additionally, there are several areas
within the right and left lungs peripherally, with patchy
opacity and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 239**] opacities, concerning for multifocal
opacity. There is also a wedge-shaped opacity in the right lower
lung zone, some of which may represent atelectasis.There is a
3.3 x 2.6 cm nodule with multiple foci of calcification within
the left lower lobe. Attempt to obtain images from [**Hospital **] hospital
regarding pulmonary lesions for comparison, [**Name (NI) 653**] with
MEdical records to sent ua CD images. Medicine and
interventional pulmonary services recommended continue
antibiotics, and follow up with chest CT with and with out
contrast in 4 weeks in pulmonary clinic. In the mean time
[**Name (NI) 653**] with Dr [**First Name (STitle) **] at the [**Hospital **] hospital regarding
tranfering him over to VA regarding his known pulmonary process,
and colon carcinoma for further work up which he was agreed with
the transfer.
.
Pleural fluid culture grew out positive to MSSA, GNR, [**Female First Name (un) 564**]
albicans, staph coag neg. BAL culture grew out Stenotrophomonas
maltophila and Klebsiella sensitive to almost all abx tested.
ID was consulted and created antibiotic regimen of clindamycin,
bactrim, ceftriaxone, to be continued for 4-6 weeks.  Levo was
completed for 2 weeks (last date [**2133-1-27**]).  Patient should be
reassessed to refine abx regimen within 2-4 weeks.  The patient
greatly improved on suctioning and chest PT, maintaining >95% RA
on the floor.
.
The following labs will need to be followed up after discharge:
LFTs, mycolytic/fungal cx, Cdiff x3, legionella urinary antigen
.
# Urinary retention:
Patient had no urine output after foley was d/ced.  Straight
cath released 980 ml of urine.  After 2 days of straight caths,
patient recovered normal urination, and does not have a foley
upon discharge.
.
# Skin lesions:
Dermatology consulted in reference to his left deltoid skin
lesion, non-bleeding which is present for 5 year according to
patient. Dermotalogy recommended excision of the lesion to rule
out melanoma once acute issues resolved with Derm Surgery
([**Telephone/Fax (1) 2977**]).
.
# Anemia:
Patient's Hct was around 25 during admission.
.
# HTN:
Controlled.  Diltiazem and captopril were continued as per her
outpt regimen.
.
# Access: Picc placed [**2133-1-9**].

Medications on Admission:
The patient is a 56 y/[**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4746**] with a PMH significant for sigmoid
and testicular cancer in '[**25**], HTN, and COPD who was admitted to
the neurosurgery service on [**2132-12-31**] with a new diagnosis of a
pontine mass after 1yr of progressive dizziness and ataxia. He
underwent a stereotactic bx on [**12-31**] showing a low grade glioma
and received a palliative posterior fossa expansion on [**1-2**].
.
Routine pre-op CXR revealed multiple opacities and a 3x3 cm well
demarcated cavitary lesion with an air/fluid level in left
posterior lung. Following his surgery, he was extubated w/out
event but required reintubation later that evening [**1-22**]
desaturation.  On [**1-3**], a chest CT was done which showed a
multifocal pneumonic process with LLL necrotizing PNA. He
underwent a bronch on [**1-4**] with BAL revealing MSSA and
stenotrophamonas and was started on Levofloxacin (now d10/14),
Vanco (since d/c), and Clinda (d10/42) at this time. Bactrim
(d5/14) was added on [**1-8**] when BAL grew stenotrophamonas.
.
During this time, he has been intermittantly hypoxic with thick
secretions requiring frequent suctioning.  Over the past 2d, he
has been afebrile and his secretions have cleared appreciably.
He has maintained his O2 sats on 4L NC.  Other than this, the
patient has been intermittantly hypertensive requiring the
addition of captopril to his outpatient regimen.  He has also
failed numerous speech and swallow evaluations requring NG tube
feeds to maintain his nutritional status.  From an oncologic
standpoint, his pontine lesion is not amenable to resection and
the plan is to initiate palliative radiation therapy.  Per
neurosurgery, his prognosis is extremely poor.  Finally, the
patient has requested transfer to the [**Location 1268**] VA system
over the past several days as he has received much of his care
at this hospital.  Discussions are still ongoing to facilitate
this transfer.

 PORTABLE CHEST:

 INDICATION:  CAD, status post MI.  Status post CVA with history of
 hypertension.  Presents with V. Tach and CHF.  Check for failure, infiltrate.

 FINDINGS:  A single AP semiupright image.  No comparison study.  The heart
 shows light ventricular enlargement.  The aorta is dilated and slightly
 unfolded.  The heart and mediastim are displaced slightly to the right.  There
 is evidence of some atelectatic changes in the basal segments of the right
 lower lobe.  There is also suggestion of a small right pleural effusion.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  LV enlargement without evidence of cardiac failure.

 2.  Atelectatic changes in right lung base, possibly associated with a small
 effusion.

 3.  Standard PA and left lateral views are recommended to evaluate this
 further.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 CARDIAC MRI:

 CLINICAL HISTORY:  The patient is a 61 y/o man with ventricular tachycardia
 status post ablation of two foci.

 TECHNIQUE:   The examination was performed at 1.5T with a dedicated cardiac
 phased array coil.  EKG, pulse, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure were
 continuously monitored during the examination.  The patient was stable
 throughout the entire examination.  Breath hold cine FIESTA images were
 acquired in the left ventricular 2 chamber, 4 chamber, horizontal long axis,
 and short axis. Gadolinium enhanced T1 weighted images were also obtained to
 look for scar.  Analysis was performed on a 3D workstation.

 FINDINGS:  Moderate sized bilateral pleural effusions are present.  There is a
 small pericardial effusion.  The ascending aorta measures 3.3 cm in transverse
 diameter, which is within normal limits.  The descending thoracic aorta
 measures 2.4 cm in transverse diameter which is also within normal limits.
 There is no evidence of dissection.  The main pulmonary artery appears within
 normal limits.

 The left ventricular end diastolic volume measured 194 ml.  The end systolic
 volume is 147 ml.  The stroke volume is 47 ml.  The ejection fraction is
 24.3%.  Based on a body surface area of 1.9 m2, the calculated left
 ventricular volume index = 102 ml/m2, which is mildly increased.  The
 calculated left ventricular ejection fraction = 25%, which is severely
 depressed.  The calculated left ventricular mass index = 89, which is normal.
 The left ventricle was noted to be diffusely hypokinetic.  The left
 ventricular wall at the apex and distal inferior wall is markedly thinned,
 consistent with scar from an old infarct.  The left ventricular apex is
 aneurysmal.  There is no evidence of thrombus within the aneurysm.  It is
 difficult to evaluate for delayed myocardial enhancement in the apex and
 distal inferior wall due to severe thinning, however, the ifnerior wall
 clearly shows scar with some lateral wall extension, was well. The remainder
 of the left ventricle demonstrates normal enhancement. The mitral valve
 appears within normal limits.  The aortic valve is tricuspid, and appears
 within normal limits.

 Analysis performed on a 3D work station were essential to the interpretation
 of this case.

 IMPRESSION:

 1)  Large left ventricular aneurysm at the apex with severe thinning of the
 left ventricular myocardial wall, as described above.  There is no evidence of
 thrombus.
 2) Scar in the inferior wall with some extension to the lateral wall as well.
 2)  Diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with severely depressed ejection
 fraction of 24%. The basal portions of the myocardial show the best function.

 INDICATION:  32-year-old man status post ATV accident.  Evaluate for fracture.

 No comparison studies.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial CT images of the thoracic spine were obtained without IV
 contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformations were performed.

 FINDINGS:  There is a burst fracture of the vertebral body of T12 with
 posterior fracture fragments being retropulsed into the bony spinal canal with
 a moderate amount of dural compression favoring the right side. The
 fracture also involves the posterior elements of T12.  There is no
 neuroforaminal narrowing. A small anterior fracture fragment is noted which
 does not appear to enter the peritoneal cavity or penetrate any adjacent
 vasculature.

 There are associated nondisplaced fractures extending through the right and
 medial left lamina of T12. No additional fractures are visualized throughout
 the thoracic spine.  There is normal vertebral body and disc space heights in
 the remaining vertebrae. Diffuse interstitial opacities are seen throughout
 the limited visualized lung bases.

 IMPRESSION:

 Burst fracture of the T12 vertebral body with retropulsion of bone fragments
 into the canal, resulting in moderate dural compression. Nondisplaced lamina
 fractures as described above.

 Evaluation of the spinal cord is limited given the lack of soft tissue
 discrimination by CT. An MRI is recommended for better evaluation of the
 spinal cord.

 INDICATION:  32-year-old man status post ATV accident.  Evaluate for bleed or
 fracture.

 No comparison studies.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast CT of the head.

 FINDINGS:  There is no definite evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.  There is
 some asymmetry demonstrated of the right lateral ventricle, which appears
 smaller than the left, which is likely secondary to the angle of the acquired
 slice rather than any mass effect.  [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation appears
 preserved. There is no major acute vascular territorial infarction.  There is
 a mucoid retention cyst within the left maxillary sinus.  There is some
 mucosal thickening within the ethmoid sinuses. The remaining paranasal sinuses
 and the mastoid air cells are well aerated. The surrounding osseous and soft
 tissue structures are unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:

 Slight asymmetry of the right and left frontal [**Doctor Last Name 218**] lateral ventricles likely
 secondary to slice angle.  No definite evidence of intracranial hemorrhage. If
 there is further clinical concern, a repeat head CT can be performed within
 the next 24 hours.

 INDICATION:  32-year-old with T12 fracture and retropulsed fracture fragment,
 assess for cord edema.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted images of the thoracic spine
 without the administration of IV contrast.

 Comparison is made to thoracic spine CT performed 15 minutes earlier.

 FINDINGS:  There is a burst fracture of the T12 vertebral body with
 retropulsion of fracture fragments into the left aspect of the spinal canal
 with resultant cord compression.  Increased signal intensity is seen in the
 spinal cord at this level extending superiorly posterior to the T11 vertebral
 body.  Increased signal intensity is seen in the soft tissues posteriorly at
 the level of T12, suggestive of ligamentous injury.  On the sagittal T1-
 weighted images, there is a convex rim of slightly increased T1 signal
 intensity posterior to the T12 vertebral body extending superiorly to the
 T11-12 disc interspace and inferiorly along the L1 vertebral body, which may
 represent a small epidural hematoma.

 Visualized intra-abdominal contents appear normal.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Burst fracture of the T12 vertebral body with retropulsed fracture
 fragment causing spinal cord compression and edema at this level.
 2.  Probable small epidural hematoma at the T12 level extending superiorly to
 the T11-12 interspace and inferiorly, posterior to the L1 vertebral body.

 Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1292**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3757**] at 4:00 p.m. on [**2186-10-2**].

 STUDY:  Carotid series complete.

 REASON:  Preop CABG.  Status post bilateral carotid endarterectomy in [**2179**].

 FINDINGS:

 Duplex evaluation was performed of bilateral carotid arteries.  There is no
 significant plaque noted in the right or left carotid arteries.

 On the right, peak systolic velocities are 73, 48, and 68 cm per second in the
 ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively.  The ICA end-diastolic velocity is 26 cm per
 second.  The ICA:CCA ratio is 1.5.  This is consistent with no significant
 stenosis.

 On the left, peak systolic velocities are 64, 85, and 62 cm per second in the
 ICA, CCA, and ECA respectively.  The ICA end-diastolic velocity is 25 cm per
 second.  The ICA:CCA ratio is 0.8.  This is consistent with no significant
 stenosis.

 There is antegrade vertebral artery flow bilaterally.

 IMPRESSION:

 No significant stenosis of the right or left ICA.

Brief Hospital Course:
On [**2192-11-19**] the patient underwent cardiac cath which revealed:
70%LAD, 80% D1, 60% LCX, 90% rca, mild AS, AV gradient of
15mmHg. He had a heavily calcified aorta and coronaries.  Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] was consulted and on [**2192-11-20**] he underwent CABGx3 with
LIMA->LAD, SVG->PDA and OM.  Cross clamp time was 63 minutes and
total bypass time was 47 minutes.  He required a urology consult
intraoperatively and had to have a foley placed under cysto.  He
tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to the CSRU in
stable condition on Neo and Propofol. He was extubated on his
postoperative night and had his chest tubes d/c'd  and was
transferred to the floor on POD#2.  On POD#4 he was in afib and
was very hpotensive and was transferred back to the CSRU.  He
was started on Amiodorone and converted to SR. He was
transferred back to the fllor on POD#5 and had a few more
episodes of controlled AF. He was then anticoagulated with
heparin and coumadin and was discharged to rehab on POD#7 in
stable condition.

Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 40239**] is a 42-year-old
gentleman injured in a motorcycle versus car accident.  The
patient was the passenger of the motorcycle.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  No prior medical problems.

MEDICATIONS:  No outpatient medications.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was brought to the
Trauma Bay where he underwent full evaluation and
resuscitation by the trauma team.  The patient was found to
have a left open comminuted fracture of the left lower
extremity with a significant degloving injury.  The patient
was taken to the Operating Room for washout and external
fixation of the patient's fracture by the orthopedic team.
In addition, the patient received a consult from the vascular
surgery team which determined that the patient was vascularly
intact.  Following his initial washout, the patient was taken
to the Intensive Care Unit for close observation.

On hospital day #2, the patient was transferred to the floor
as he had been hemodynamically and neurologically stable.  On
hospital day #4, the patient was taken to the Operating Room
again for a combined procedure with the orthopedic and
plastic surgery team.  Orthopedic team placed an
intramedullary nail into the patient's left tibia.  A plastic
surgery team then covered the patient's open defect with a
rectus free flap.  The patient tolerated the procedure well
and there were no intraoperative complications.  The patient
was initially monitored in the stepdown Intensive Care Unit
for close observation of this flap.  The patient also had a
split thickness skin graft placed over the flap, as the
patient had significant loss of skin tissue from his
degloving injury.  The patient did well after surgery and
flap had no complications.  Throughout his stay, the patient
continued to have a strong Dopplerable signal both arterial
and venous and a good take of his skin graft.

On postoperative day #2, the patient was transferred to the
floor as he no longer required hourly flap checks.  Beginning
on postoperative day #5, the patient was allowed to begin
dangling his left lower extremity which he tolerated without
any problems.  On postoperative day #7, the patient was seen
by the physical therapist for instructions on non weight
bearing of the left lower extremity transfers to chair.  At
this point, the patient was medically stable and ready for
discharge to a rehabilitation facility.

Throughout his stay, the patient was also given aspirin q day
and deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis with subcutaneous
heparin.  The patient was also on Kefzol for the duration of
his stay.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient was stable during
discharge.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to a
rehabilitation facility, as the patient will have orthopedic
ambulatory difficulties given his non weight bearing status
on his left lower extremity.  He will continue to be non
weight bearing on the left lower extremity with dangling
only, however the patient may transfer to a chair as long as
his left lower extremity is elevated.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Keflex 500 mg po qid
2.  Aspirin 81 mg po q day
3.  Lopressor 25 mg po bid
4.  Percocet 1 to 2 tablets po q 4 to 6 hours prn
5.  Colace 100 mg po bid
6.  Zolpidem 5 mg po q hs prn

OTHER INSTRUCTIONS:  The patient may begin showering or
having a spray of water over his wound, however the patient
is not to have any tub soaks.  The patient should not
progress on his weight bearing status until after his follow
up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] in one week.

  73 year old man with PUD s/p BII
 REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
  73 yo male s/p ERCP today with massive hemobilia. Please assess for
  pseudoanuerysm. He also has a h/o multiple myeloma and theoretically could be
  bleeding from myeloma in liver
 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY: 73 year-old male presents with massive hemobilia found during ERCP.
 Patient has history of cholangitis and multiple myeloma.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Drs. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 134**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 135**] and [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 25640**],
 with Attending Radiologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 135**] being present during the entire
 procedure.

 PROCEDURE & FINDINGS:  The risks and benefits were explained to the patient
 and consent was obtained.

 The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table and the right groin
 was prepped and draped in sterile fashion.  Under local anesthesia using 1%
 Lidocaine, the right common femoral artery was accessed using a 19-gauge
 needle and a .035 [**Last Name (un) 414**] wire was advanced into the abdominal aorta.  The
 needle was exchanged for a 5 French sheath with the side arm connected to
 continuous Heparinized saline irrigation.  A 5 French C2 glide Cobra catheter
 was placed over the wire and cannulated the celiac trunk. Selective angiogrphy
 was performed and showed no extravasation from the branches of the celiac
 trunk, splenic artery, left gastric and left hepatic arteries with no evidence
 of contrast extravasation or aneurysm.  The right lobe of the liver is not
 supplied by the celiac trunk. The proper hepatic artery was then
 superselctively catherized with a Tracker catheter and an angiogram was
 obtained which showed absence of extravasation. However there was non-filling
 of the the right hepatic artery branches. The superior mesenteric artery was
 then cathetrized and showed he replaced right hepatic artery . Then
 superselctive catheterization of the replaced hepatic artery was undertaken
 since there was question of an arterioportal fistula based on the short
 appearance of a blush. A superselective angiogram was performed and again
 showed no suspicious vasculature for biliary system bleeding.  The Cobra
 catheter was also used to cannulate the superior mesenteric artery and
 selective angiogram of SMA showed unremarkable SMA and its branches.  There is
                                                             (Over)

 (Cont)
 a replaced right hepatic artery arising from the very proximal portion of the
 SMA supplying the right lobe of the liver.  The branches of the right hepatic
 artery appear normal in configuration.  However, there is approximately 7 mm
 contrast blush in the mid portion of the right lobe of the liver on AP view.
 This was originally suspected for arterial- portal fistula.  A 3 French
 Tracker catheter was placed through the Cobra catheter and advanced to the
 branch of the right hepatic artery leading to the lesion and superselective
 angiogram was performed, which showed that contrast blush starting filling in
 the late arterial phase and lasting into the portal venous phase.  This is
 more consistent with hemangioma.  Again, there is no contrast extravasation
 from the right hepatic branches.

 Incidentally noted are the bilateral moderate hydronephrosis and a tubular
 structure in the left upper quadrant likely representing dislodged biliary
 stent.

 At the end of the procedure the sheath was removed and local hemostasis was
 achieved by manual compression.

 MEDICATIONS:  A total of 1.5 mg Versed and 50 mcg Fentanyl was given in small
 divided doses.  Optiray 320 was used for angiograms.

 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of active bleeding or aneurysmal changes in the
 celiac and SMA systems. Small hemangioma in the right lobe of the liver
 supplied by the replaced right hepatic artery. Hydronephrosis.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post ERCP with hemorrhage during procedure.

 TECHNIQUE:  Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
 lung bases to the pubic symphysis following administration of IV contrast
 only.  Initial non-contrast and arterial-phase contrast images were obtained
 with subsequent portal venous and delayed timing.

 CT OF ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a densely calcified pleural-based
 nodule in the right lower lobe and a second non-calcified nodule on the
 lateral aspect of the left lower lobe.  The patient is status post
 cholecystectomy.  There is a focally dilated central common hepatic duct and
 peripheral biliary duct in the posterior right lobe of the liver.  There is
 marked thickening and enhancement of the common bile duct, extending down to
 the level of the ampulla.  There is no evidence of a pancreatic mass.  Low
 attenuation material is noted adjacent to this common bile duct. The pancreas,
 spleen, adrenal glands, and visualized loops of bowel are unremarkable. The
 abdominal vasculature is normal.  Well circumscribed low attenuation foci are
 seen in the cortices of both kidneys, consistent with simple cysts.  Extensive
 peripancreatic and periportal subcentimeter lymph nodes are noted, along with
 multiple subcentimeter retroperitoneal lymph nodes.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  The rectum, sigmoid colon, prostate and
 bladder are unremarkable. There are dilated bilateral distal ureters.  There
 are no inguinal or deep pelvic lymph nodes that meet CT criteria for
 pathologic enlargement.  There are bilateral fluid-containing inguinal
 hernias.

 The ossoeus windows demonstrate extensive diffuse mixed sclerotic and lytic
 changes with extension of the medulla and cortex in the right sacrum, iliac
 bone and femoral head and neck.  In addition, there is a large soft tissue
 mass associated with these changes in the left ilium, measuring 3.9 x 6.7 cm.
 An additional soft tissue mass is noted involving the right 12th rib.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. Dilated common bile duct with wall thickening and enhancement, which could
 either be related to recent hemobilia or cholangitis.
 2. Diffuse extensive bony lesions, consistent with multiple myeloma and pelvic
 plasmocytoma.  In addition, there are scattered lower lobe pulmonary nodules.
 3. Dilated bilateral distal ureters.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Status post ERCP bleed and transfer out of
SICU.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a pleasant
73-year-old gentleman with a past medical history significant
for multiple myeloma, peptic ulcer disease, cholangitis, iron
deficiency anemia, B12 deficiency anemia, status post
cholecystectomy and appendectomy, who was transferred to the
[**Hospital1 69**] from [**Hospital3 **] for
an ERCP.  The patient had an ERCP that was done on [**2-9**], and had a stent placed with no significant findings
except for mild dilatation, but no stones or strictures.  The
patient had developed gram-negative (Klebsiella grown and E.
coli) rod sepsis and jaundice prior to the first ERCP.

The patient did well for a few days, and then on [**2-18**],
presented with a one day history of right upper quadrant
pain, no nausea, vomiting, fever, or rigors.  A MRI that was
done after [**2-9**] showed abnormal tissue in the region of
porta hepatis and some lymphadenopathy.  So patient was
transferred here for a repeat ERCP.

During the ERCP procedure, the initial contrast revealed an
amorphous intraductal mass.  With further manipulation and
extraction of the mass, there was an old blood clot and once
the blood clot was removed, bright red blood began to drain
from the biliary system.  The GI fellow estimated about 1
unit of blood loss.  The patient was stable and alert during
and after the procedure, and was transferred to the Intensive
Care Unit for further management and eventually to
Interventional Radiology for an A-gram.

An A-gram was done that showed no active bleeding, however,
the stent that was placed in the common bile duct was no
longer there.  The patient was then transferred to the floor
after the hematocrit had been stable for greater than 24
hours and there was no evidence of any new acute bleed.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Multiple myeloma diagnosed in [**2128**].
2. Peptic ulcer disease.
3. Cholangitis.
4. Iron deficiency anemia.
5. B12 deficiency anemia.
6. Status post cholecystectomy in [**2128**].
7. Status post appendectomy.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1. Iron 325 mg po q day.
2. Colace 100 mg po bid.
3. Levaquin 500 mg po q day.
4. Ambien 5 mg po q day.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his brother, [**Name (NI) **]
[**Name (NI) **], and the patient denies any alcohol, smoking, or IV
drug abuse at this time.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION TO THE UNIT:  Temperature of 97.0,
blood pressure 130/55, heart rate of 105, respiratory rate
20, and O2 saturation 100% on room air.  General:
Comfortable, in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Moist mucosal
membranes.  Extraocular movements are intact.  Pupils are
equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation.
Cardiovascular:  S1, S2 slightly tachycardic, no murmurs,
rubs, or gallops heard.  Lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen is soft, nondistended, mild tenderness
in the epigastric area to deep palpation, decreased bowel
sounds.  Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.
Skin:  No evidence of any rash.  Neurologic:  Cranial nerves
II through XII tested grossly intact.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White count 5.3, hematocrit 21.2,
platelets of 301, sodium 133, potassium 3.1, chloride 106,
bicarb 20, BUN 13, creatinine 0.4, glucose 117, ALT 303, AST
167, alkaline phosphatase 704, total bilirubin 1.2.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. GI:  Patient was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit after
an ERCP because of a bleed.  The patient's hematocrit at that
time was 21.2 and the patient received 2 units and hematocrit
was checked q6h for 24-48 hours.  His hematocrit continued to
remain stable between 25-27, however, one additional unit of
blood was given when the patient was transferred to the floor
and his hematocrit continued to remain stable in the range of
29-31.  The patient also had a repeat CT angiogram for
pancreatic protocol that was done on [**2-23**], and it was
found that there was no evidence of any mass and patient had
a dilated common bile duct with wall thickening and
enhancement which is consistent with either hemobilia or
cholangitis.

However, patient's findings were most likely secondary to his
hemobilia since he did have a bleed after his ERCP.  In
addition, the CT angiogram did show extensive bony
involvement of his multiple myeloma.  Also during the
hospital course, the patient was started on broad antibiotic
coverage consisting of ampicillin, Flagyl, and Levaquin for
prophylaxis against developing cholangitis.  During the
hospital course, the patient did not seem to have any right
upper quadrant tenderness or epigastric tenderness that would
be concerned with cholangitis, and on the date of discharge,
he was sent with Levaquin 500 mg po q day for seven
additional days.

The patient's diet was also slowly advanced.  He was made NPO
after his procedure for about two days and was started on a
liquid diet and then eventually into a soft diet all of which
the patient tolerated well.

2. Oncology:  The patient has a history of multiple myeloma,
and as per the CT angiogram, it appears that there is
extensive metastases to the bones.  A brief discussion was
brought up with the patient regarding further management, and
if he wanted to see an oncologist at that time, he said that
his care is provided by Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 49935**] in the [**Location (un) 5871**]
area, and patient would want to talk to him before pursuing
any further intervention.  However, the patient would prefer
to let it be as it is, and did not appear to be interested in
any chemotherapy, or radiation therapy, or even talking to an
oncologist during this hospital course.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Status post ERCP bleed.
2. Multiple myeloma.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  The patient is stable at time of
discharge.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Protonix 40 mg po q day.
2. Levofloxacin 500 mg po q day x7 days.
3. The patient is to continue taking all of his outpatient
medications.

FOLLOWUP:  The patient was asked to setup an appointment with
his primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**Last Name (STitle) 49935**] in the next 3-4 days.
The patient states that he would call and setup an
appointment, according to his own time.

[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 62390**] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2186-11-21**] for elective
surgical management of his aortic stenosis. He was taken
directly to the operating room where he underwent an aortic
valve replacement utilizing a 25mm St. [**Male First Name (un) 923**] porcine valve.
Postoperatively he was taken to the cardiac surgical intensive
care unit for monitoring. On postoperative day one, he awoke
neurologically intact and was extubated. He was initially
slightly confused requiring a sitter however his mental status
slowly cleared. Later on postoperative day one, he was
transferred to the cardiac surgical step down unit for
monitoring. He was gently diuresed towards his preoperative
weight. Beta blockade was discontinued for low blood pressure.
The physical therapy service was consulted to help increase his
postoperative strength and mobility. Mr. [**Known lastname 62390**] developed
atrial fibrillation which converted spontaneously back into
normal sinus rhythm. Mr. [**Known lastname 62390**] continued to make steady
progress and was discharged to rehabilitation on postoperative
day six. He will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], his
cardiologist and his primary care physician as an outpatient.
Beta blockade should be resumed as an outpatient when his blood
pressure can tolerate.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted sequences were obtained through
 the brain with diffusion-weighted imaging and multiplanar post-gadolinium T1
 imaging.

 FINDINGS:  There is no slow diffusion to indicate an acute infarct.  There are
 no enhancing abnormalities.  There is increased T1 signal within the basal
 ganglia prior to the administration of IV contrast.  These findings are
 commonly seen in patients with liver failure.  There is no midline shift, mass
 effect, or hydrocephalus.  No areas of abnormal magnetic susceptibility are
 noted.  Normal vascular flow voids are present.

 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of an enhancing abnormality or mass.

 No acute infarct.

 Increased T1 signal in the basal ganglia bilaterally consistent with the
 patient's history of hepatic failure.

 INDICATION:  Fever and seizures.

 The examination is technically limited due to incomplete imaging of the
 lateral portion of the left mid and lower lung regions.  Additionally, the
 patient is rotated.

 The heart is normal in size and there is no evidence of mediastinal or hilar
 widening.  Incompletely imaged left pleural effusion is present with adjacent
 basilar opacities that suggest atelectasis.

 When the patient's condition permits, a repeat radiograph to include the
 entirety of the left lung is recommended and can be performed at no additional
 charge to the patient.

 ABDOMINAL ULTRASOUND:  Reference is made to abdominal CT from [**2190-10-13**].  The
 liver is echogenic consistent with known cirrhosis.  No focal mass is
 identified.  The gallbladder wall is thick with some areas of edema, likely
 secondary to underlying liver disease.  No gallstones are identified.  There
 is massive splenomegaly with the spleen measuring 17.7 cm.  Doppler assessment
 of blood flow to the liver shows patent main portal, anterior, and posterior
 right portal vein, and left portal veins, were all with appropriate antegrade
 flow.  The hepatic veins are patent.  Normal hepatic arterial waveforms are
 present.

 Four quadrant ultrasound shows a moderate amount of ascites.  No suitable spot

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Cirrhosis, ascites.  Fever and abdominal pain.  Question SBP.
 Ultrasounded-guided paracentesis.

 TECHNIQUE/PROCEDURE:  Ultrasound-guided paracentesis was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
 and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1886**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1886**] present and supervising.  A pre-procedure
 timeout was performed to verify the patient as well as the procedure.  Written
 informed consent was obtained from power of attorney (patient's mother) with
 verbal consent from the patient after explaining the anticipated benefits and
 potential risks of the procedure.  Of note, the patient had impaired
 coagulation.  Two units of FFP were administered prior to the procedure.

 Pre-procedure ultrasound imaging showed a moderate amount of ascites fluid,
 particularly in both lower quadrants, but more on the left than on the right.
 Under ultrasound guidance, an entry location was chosen and marked in the left
 lower quadrant.  Left lower quadrant was prepped and draped in the usual
 sterile fashion.  After administration of approximately 8 cc of 1% lidocaine
 into the subcutaneous tissues, a skin [**Doctor Last Name 111**] was made, and a 19-gauge [**Last Name (un) 553**]
 catheter subsequently advanced into the peritoneal fluid collection.
 Approximately 20 cc of clear-yellow ascites fluid was aspirated for the
 requested laboratory and microbiology examinations.  Subsequently, 500 cc of
 ascites fluid was aspirated to effect some symptomatic relief.  At the
 completion of the examination, ultrasound evaluation showed a small amount of
 residual ascites fluid.

 Targeted ultrasound of the portal vein was also performed as requested,
 demonstrating no evidence of portal vein thrombosis, with appropriate
 hepatopetal directional flow of the main portal vein.

 There are no associated post-procedure complications; samples were hand
 delivered to the laboratory control desk.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Successful ultrasound-guided diagnostic and therapeutic paracentesis.

 2.  Hepatopetal flow of the main portal vein.

 RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA:
    26.9 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m MDP ([**2191-1-18**]);
 HISTORY: History of Bacteremia, ETOH, cirrhosis. Evaluate for osteomyelitis.

 INTERPRETATION:

 Anterior and Posterior flow images obtained at the level of the mid abdomen are
 normal.

 Tissue phase images of the mid abdomen demonstrate diffuse increased renal
 uptake bilaterally.

 Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and posterior
 projections. There is increased tracer uptake at the approximate T7 level at the
 costovertebral junction on the left that may be post-traumatic.
 There is increased tracer uptake at the approximate T10 right rib end that may
 also be post-traumatic. There is linear increased uptake in the lower sacrum
 with a transverse orientation consistent with a fracture.

 There is diffuse, bilateral increased renal uptake. Tracer activity is present
 within the bladder, the normal route of tracer excretion.

 IMPRESSION:  1) No definite evidence of osteomyelitis.  2) Linear increased
 lower sacral uptake consistent with a fracture.  3) Marked, diffuse bilateral
 increased renal uptake is non-specific and may be secondary to interstitial
 nephritis.

IMAGING:
MRI HEAD:
FINDINGS: There is no slow diffusion to indicate an acute
infarct. There are no enhancing abnormalities. There is
increased T1 signal within the basal ganglia prior to the
administration of IV contrast. These findings are commonly seen
in patients with liver failure. There is no midline shift, mass
effect, or hydrocephalus. No areas of abnormal magnetic
susceptibility are noted. Normal vascular flow voids are
present.

IMPRESSION: No evidence of an enhancing abnormality or mass.

No acute infarct.

Increased T1 signal in the basal ganglia bilaterally consistent
with the patient's history of hepatic failure.
.
TEE:
GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed
above. I certify I was present in compliance with HCFA
regulations. The patient was monitored by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 9833**]
throughout the procedure. The patient was sedated for the TEE.
Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test Information
section). The posterior pharynx was anesthetized with 2% viscous
lidocaine. No TEE related complications. 0.1 mg of IV
glycopyrrolate was given as an antisialogogue prior to TEE probe
insertion.
Conclusions:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of
the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right
atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal
(LVEF>55%). Right ventricular systolic function is normal. The
ascending, transverse and descending thoracic aorta are normal
in diameter and free of atherosclerotic plaque. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet
excursion. No masses or vegetations are seen on the aortic
valve. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears
structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. No mass
or vegetation is seen on the mitral valve.
IMPRESSION: No echo evidence of endocarditis.

BONE SCAN
IMPRESSION:
1) No definite evidence of osteomyelitis.
2) Linear increased
lower sacral uptake consistent with a fracture.
3) Marked, diffuse bilateral increased renal uptake is
non-specific and may be secondary to interstitial nephritis


Brief Hospital Course:
38 y/o M w/ Alcohol/HepC cirrhosis with admitted with s. aureus
bacteremia, and seizure.
.
1) [**Name (NI) 11646**] unclear source.  Patient did not have localizing
signs or symptoms (other than chronic abdominal pain) and did
not have a history c/w meningitis/meningoencephalitis.  He
underwent TTE and TEE while in the ICU, both w/o evidence of
vegetation.  Surveillance cultures remained negative (although
all drawn on abx) and patient was w/o evidence of embolic or
immunologic phenomena on examination.  He remaineed afebrile in
house.  He also underwent bone scan to r/o occult osteomyelitis,
which did not show evidence of infectious focus.  LP was
deferred per neuro recommendations- it was felt that the patient
had been on antibiotics for approximately 5days on transfer from
OSH and his coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia would induce
additional risk for the procedure.  At the OSH, the patient was
initially started on vancomycin and CTX.  When sensitivities
returned as MSSA the patient was switched to nafcillin.  He
completed 12 days of antibiotic therapy and subsequently
developed ARF (Cr peaked at 3.5) but rapidly recovered.
FENA>1%, u/s neg, eos neg (including peripheral), sediment
bland.  Bone scan did show evidence of increased renal uptake
c/w intersitial nephritis.  He completed the last two days of a
total 14 day course with vancomycin.   He was afebrile on
discharge, w/ plan to obtain repeat blood cultures on Monday
[**1-24**].
.
2) [**Name (NI) **] unclear etiology. Patient w/o sz hx.  Interestingly,
the patient seized at the OSH on hospital d3.  This course was
concerning for etoh w/d but patient vehemently denies further
alcohol use.   He was initially loaded on dilantin and
subsequently maintained on keppra.   EEG did not show evidence
of sz focus.  Plan for patient to f/u w/ Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 951**] of Neurology.
.
3) Acute hepatitis- patient admitted to OSH with AST of approx
80, ALT approx 40.  These trended down following admission but
the patient subsequently developed a cholestatic appearance on
labs, with his bilirubin peaking at 15.7 and INR at 2.7.  Both
were trending down on discharge.  Again, the patient denied
alcohol use.
.
4) ARF- likely interstitial nephritis, as discussed above
.
5) ESLD- on discharge, plan to start re-start diuretics pending
evaluation of renal function on Monday.  Patient was continued
on lactulose in house.
.
6) Abdominal Pain - chronic abdominal pain in house.  Minimal
ascites but underwent ultrasound guided paracentesis that ruled
out SBP.

Service:  CME


HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 45-year-old
male with a history of GERD, standing with substernal chest
pain while working at a construction site, which he thought
was his GERD, then worsened in a few hours.  After about 2
hours, he went to the emergency department.  The pain was
radiating down both arms with his chest pressure.  No nausea,
diaphoresis or shortness of breath.  In the emergency
department, he was found to have lateral ST elevations in V4
through V6 and ST elevations in 2 equal to 3 and aVF.  He
went into ventricular fibrillation arrest.  In the emergency
department, he was shocked to normal sinus rhythm, given
thrombolysis with TNK.  At 4:52 a.m., he was transferred to
[**Hospital1 18**] for emergent catheterization.  At the catheterization,
they found right ventricular pressure of 38/14, pulmonary
capillary wedge mean pressure at 25, and 98 percent
thrombotic occlusion in OM1.  PTCA and stent with heparin-
coated stent was placed.  ST elevations resolved after
catheterization and patient was pain free.  Patient then
developed automated idioventricular rhythm after TNK at
outside hospital.  On arrival after catheterization here, he
was pain free with small right groin hematoma.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Stable vital signs and normal sinus
rhythm.  His temperature afebrile, heart rate 73, blood
pressure 128/71, respirations 16, oxygen saturation 95
percent on 2 liters.  Generally, in no acute distress.  Alert
and oriented x 3.  No carotid bruits.  HEENT:  Mucous
membranes moist.  JVP at 10 cm.  Cardiovascular:  Regular
rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops.  Pulmonary:
Clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Abdomen:  Soft,
nontender, nondistended, normoactive bowel sounds.
Extremities:  No edema.  Trace dorsalis pedis pulses, 2 plus
posterior pulses bilaterally.  Small right groin hematoma.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count 11.8, hematocrit 40.6,
platelets 269, INR 1.3, sodium 137, potassium 4.6, chloride
104, bicarbonate 23, BUN 19, creatinine 0.9, and glucose 108.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Ischemia.  Patient had inferior ST
elevation MI.  He was given thrombolysis at the outside
hospital but was transferred for persistent pain and ST
elevations.  His PTCA here was a heparin coated stent to the
OM 1.  He was given aspirin, Plavix, Lopressor, Lipitor 80
mg, and started on ACE inhibitor.  CK is peaked at 3869.
Pump likely moderate-sized inferolateral MI.  Echocardiogram
showed left atrial elongation, mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy, inferolateral hypokinesis/akinesis,
mild dilated aortic root, trivial MR ejection fraction of 30
percent.  He was started on Coumadin and heparin for
increased risk of thrombosis with no telemetry events.  He
will have a signal-average EKG and follow up with
electrophysiology for T-wave alternans in 3 to 4 weeks.

Cocaine use.  Patient has been counseled regarding the risk
of using cocaine including risk of MI and CVA as well as
sudden death.  He was seen by [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2412**] and given phone
numbers for several detoxification programs.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:  Patient was discharged to home.

FOLLOWUP PLANS:  Patient has to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 11493**], his
new cardiologist and primary care provider.  [**Name10 (NameIs) **] will arrange
for the patient to begin a cardiac rehabilitation program.
The patient can go to his office at 11:00 a.m. on [**2170-3-26**].
He has also to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] regarding his
signal-average EKG and
T-wave alternans testing for risk of further arrhythmias.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 2704**]
Chief Complaint:
Admit for carotid angiography and possible intervention.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
S/P stenting of left carotid artery


History of Present Illness:
64 year-old woman, patient of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 122**]
[**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], with an extensive history of CAD,
now s/p recent left upper lobectomy for lung cancer with an
incidental finding of an old CVA on head CT postoperatively
prompting a workup that revealed 90% left internal carotid
stenosis on duplex, vs 55% on CTA of neck, now referred for left
carotid angiography to more clearly define her carotid anatomy,
and carotid intervention, if appropriate. Events were as
follows:
[**2128-9-28**] IMI - Treated with stenting of the RCA and LCx. Found
to have severe MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 12876**] and was referred for
surgical repair.
[**2128-10-27**] Mitral valve surgery aborted after TEE at time of
surgery revealed largely normal mitral valve with improvement of
inferior hypokinesis compared to month prior.
[**3-/2129**] Cardiac Catheterization - Total occlusion of RCA stent and
patent LCX stent, mild to mod MR
[**7-/2129**] Pulmonary edema requiring intubation at an OSH. Transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] and had a cardiac cath revealing T.O RCA and 40% CX
stenosis in prior stent. EF of 30%
[**2129**] AICD placement
[**2135-10-24**] Cath d/t worsening chronic angina and DOE and inferior
ischemia on dobutamine viability study. Angiography revealed 40%

LAD, 40% LCX ISRS, RCA totally occluded with distal filling via
left to right collaterals. S/P Unsuccesful recanalization of the
RCA. FFR of CX lesion demonstrated it to be a hemodynamically
insignificant lesion.
[**2136-2-2**] s/p VATS, left upper lobectomy and mediastinal lymph node
dissection d/t adenocarcinoma. Patient d/c'd on [**2-8**] and
readmitted on [**2-13**] d/t mental status changes and hypotension. A
chest CT was done which was negative for a PE. A CT of the head
was done revealing no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, but a
hypodensity at the right temporo-occipital junction. This could
represent a late subacute to chronic infarct vs metastatic
disease. A CT with contrast was done the following day revealing
the same findings. A carotid series was therefore ordered and
done on [**2136-2-15**]. This revealed an 80-99% stenosis of the left
internal carotid artery and a <40% stenosis of the right
internal carotid artery. A TTE was done on [**2136-2-15**]. This
revealed an ef of 40% with 1+MR, small to moderate sized
pericardial effusion. Mild symmetric LVH. Hypokinesis noted in
the infero-septum, inferior and infero-lateral walls. Akinesis
noted in the basal infero-septum and inferior wall.
.
The patient was subsequently referred to see Dr [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 487**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]
as an outpatient who has recommended her for carotid angiography
and intervention. The patient was then seen in clinic by Dr.
[**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] of neurology who is in agreement that the head
CT scan abnormality is very likely an embolic stroke and feels
that left carotid intervention is appropriate. The patient was
also seen by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] of neurosurgery who felt that
it is exceedingly unlikely that the lesion on CT scan represents
a malignancy vs. metastasis and cleared her to undergo a carotid
procedure. He recommended repeat head CT in 3 months.
.
Follow up studies have included:
[**2136-2-23**] Chest XRAY: Normal post left upper lobectomy appearance.
No evidence of any cardiopulmonary process.
[**2136-3-8**] CTA of neck: approximately 55% left sided carotid
stenosis at the bifurcation
[**2136-3-20**] CT of brain with and without contrast: No change of
right posterior temporal-occipital region, likely represents a
chronic infarct. Noted to have tortuous basilar artery. Basilary
artery summit positioned to the left of the midline. Just
anterior to the summit is a 2-mm area of contrast
enhancement--Finding could represent very tortuous origin of
left posterior cerebral artery or contigious tiny aneurysm.
.
In terms of symptoms, the patient denies any neurological
deficits, confusion,or lightheadedness. She further denies any
chest pain. She does report having dyspnea after climbing one
flight of stairs.
.
On day of admission, she underwent carotid angiography with
stent placement

 INDICATION:  87-year-old female with chest pain status post nasogastric tube
 placement.

 COMPARISONS:  Comparison is made to [**2197-10-13**].

 TECHNIQUE:  AP single view of the chest.

 FINDINGS:  There is a right IJ dialysis catheter with the tip in the lower
 SVC.  This is unchanged when compared to prior study.  There is interval
 placement of NG tube which is coiled within the stomach with the tip in the
 body of the stomach.  The cardiac contour is enlarged but unchanged when
 compared to the prior examination.  The pulmonary vasculature is normal
 without evidence of CHF.  Lung fields are grossly clear.  There are
 calcifications in the mitral annulus.  There are surgical clips in the upper
 abdomen, likely from prior cholecystectomy.  The patient is status post
 posterior spinal fusion of the lumbar spine.

 IMPRESSION:  NG tube tip is in the stomach as described above.

 RIGHT HIP STUDY

 INDICATION:  Fall.  Right hip hematoma.

 No prior radiographs for comparison.

 AP view of the pelvis and dedicated views of the right hip are submitted for
 interpretation.  The bones are diffusely demineralized.  On one of the three
 views, there is a questionable linear lucency in the right femoral neck
 medially, not confirmed on the other views.  This is most likely projectional,
 but if there is strong clinical suspicion for acute fracture, MR should be
 considered for more complete assessment.

Brief Hospital Course:
87 year old female with ESRD on HD, CAD s/p MI and PCI, DM2, RAS
presented from OSH with hypoglycemia, hypotension, abdominal
pain, UTI, now normotensive with new epigastic pain and
persistent intermittent hypoglycemia.
--In the MICU, patient treated for UTI and question of urosepsis
with Cipro. Pyelonephritis was considered possible source of
abdominal pain. Urine cultures came back positive for
pansensitive E. coli and patient was continued on Cipro. There
was no growth in blood cultures. She was ruled out for MI with
mild troponin elevation in the setting of renal failure but flat
CKs. Patient was restarted on HD the day following admission.
Her labetolol, norvasc, clonidine, and isosorbide were held. She
had no further hypotension following initial volume
recessitation. However, she continued to be hypoglycemic at
times, thought most likely secondary to persistent blood levels
of glipizide in the setting of renal insufficiency as well as
poor po intake. Patient's po intake began to improve and prior
to transfer to the floor, BGs had improved to 70-140 [**11-16**]. MICU
stay also complicated by epigastric abdominal pain and emesis,
bilious and non-bloody. Pancreatic enzymes and LFTs were normal.
PTT and INR elevated in MICU. Heparin sc stopped. Both trended
down on repeat checks.
.
The morning after transfer, the patient was found to have
increasing nausea and vomiting that was poorly responsive to
anti-nausea meds.  As there was concern for cardiac ischemia, an
EKG was done that showed new T-wave inversions in the lateral
leads. Pt had significan troponin elevation and cardiology was
consulted.  Though the patient was likely having  mild episode
of cardiac ischemia, given the patient's significant
comorbidities and resolvation of symptoms as well as no
hemodynamic compromise, the patient was treated medically with
aspirin, plavix, beta blocker and oxygen.  The patient was
asymptomatic and had downtrending troponins.  For the remainder
of the hospital, the patient has stable vital signs and no other
complaints of chest pressure.
.
# UTI: Urine culture positive for pansensitive E coli. Was
initially treated with cipro, but with the patient's nausea and
vomiting, it was changed to levofloxacin QHD.  Pt now on day 6
of appropriate abx. Currently afebrile. CVA tenderness noted on
admission now resolved. Pyelonephritis possible cause of initial
abdominal pain but no clear evidence of that on CT abdomen from
OSH.
.
# ESRD on HD (Tues/Thurs/Sat)  Pt now on MWF schedule,
nephrology following.
- next session due [**11-20**]
- monitor electrolytes
- continue nephrocaps
.
# EPIGASTRIC TENDERNESS/VOMITING: minimal epigastric tenderness
on exam, +N/V. Unclear etiology. LFTs, pancreatic enzymes
normal. [**Month (only) 116**] be [**3-16**] to gastroparesis given h/o DM and patient
reports chronic N/V prior to admission.  Now asymptomatic, if
persists, nay need gastric emptying study.
.
# DMII: patient p/w hypoglycemia, now resolved. Was likely [**3-16**]
oral hypoglycemics in setting of worsened renal function due to
infection.  Stable finger sticks on day of discharge, pt on
insulin sliding scale
- monitor QID finger sticks
- cont to hold glyburide as was hypoglycemic
- RISS if needed
.
# HTN: Labetalol, clonidine, and norvasc held on admission to
MICU given hypotension. Restarted prior to discharge.
.
# CAD: stable, denies CP. slight troponin elevation likely [**3-16**]
renal failure, but slight elevation likely due to mild ischemic
event, managed medically as pt has multiple comorbities. CK/MB
negative.
- continue ASA, Plavix, statin
.
# Right hip pain- pt given history of falling prior to
admission. X ray on admission showed no signs of occult fracture
though small linear lucency on x ray.  Pt with large hematoma on
hip that precludes anticoagulation.
.
# HYPOTHYROIDISM: continue levothyroxine
.
# DEPRESSION: continue sertraline
.
# CODE: DNR/DNI confirmed with patient at the time of transfer

 INDICATION: 54 year old man with non-Hodgkins lymphoma here for a bone marrow
 transplant. Assess line placement and check for pneumonia prior to initiating
 chemotherapy.

 COMPARISON: [**2118-5-31**].

 FINDINGS: AP portable chest radiograph demonstrates the left sided central
 venous catheter has been removed. There is a dual lumen Hickman catheter
 entering from the right with its tip in the distal SVC. There is no change in
 the position of this catheter. There are no pulmonary infiltrates or pleural
 effusions. There is an ovoid structure in the right lung presumably
 projectional difference from the patient's rib or summation of structures with
 scapular tip.

 IMPRESSION: No pneumonia. Unusual ovoid density in the right mid lung zone
 presumably due to summation of structures. Recommend attention to this area on
 followup radiographs.

 INDICATION:  Neutropenia and fever.

 COMPARISON: [**6-17**], [**5-31**] and [**2118-5-28**].

 CHEST AP PORTABLE RADIOGRAPH:  The cardiac, mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  The left lung is clear.  There is a somewhat well circumscribed
 opacity immediately overlying the catheter which runs along the lateral right
 upper hemithorax.  No definite pulmonary infiltrates or effusions.  The
 osseous structures are unremarkable.  The right internal jugular central
 venous catheter tip extends to the distal SVC.  No pneumothorax.

 IMPRESSION:
 1)  There is a somewhat well-circumscribed but subtle opacity immediately
 adjacent to the external portion of the catheter overlying the right upper
 lobe.  This may be related to the catheter itself but it is difficult to
 exclude an underlying opacity in this region.  Correlation with physical exam
 recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  A 54-year-old man with T cell lymphoma, history of
 celiac sprue, new gastrointestinal bleed, and persistent fever.

 TECHNIQUE:  Helical axial images of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis were
 obtained with intravenous contast.  150 cc Optiray contrast were administered.
 Nonionic contrast was used secondary to the patient's debility.

 COMPARISON:  [**2118-4-20**] torso CT.

 CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is no axillary lymphadenopathy.  Several
 small, nonpathologically enlarged, mediastinal lymph nodes are present.  There
 is a right internal jugular central venous line with tip in the lower superior
 vena cava.  The heart and great vessels are unremarkable.  Multiple
 subcentimeter bilateral pulmonary nodules are present.  Two nodules in the
 right upper lobe are slightly more prominent than on the prior study.  No new
 nodules are identified.

 ABDOMEN CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  The liver, gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, and
 adrenal glands are unremarkable.  Several stable exophytic lesions are present
 within the left kidney.  The stomach is unremarkable.  There is no bowel wall
 thickening or dilatation.  The colon is unremarkable.  Multiple small
 mesenteric and peripancreatic lymph nodes are present and are stable in the
 interval.

 PELVIC CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  The distal ureters, bladder, rectum, prostate,
 and sigmoid colon are unremarkable.  There is no pelvic lymphadenopathy.

 The osseous structures are diffusely demineralized.  No suspicious lytic or
 sclerotic lesions are present.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  No abnormal fluid collection or pulmonary infiltrates to explain the
 patient's fever.

 2.  Multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, several of which are slightly more
 prominent than on the prior study.  This may be due to technical differences
 in slice selection.  Attention on follow up studies is recommended.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Neutropenic fever.  Status post multiple transfusions.

 Compared to [**2118-7-6**].

 A right internal jugular vascular remains in satisfactory position.  The heart
 size and mediastinal contours are within normal limits.  Focal opacity is
 present adjacent to the catheter at the level of the 4th anterior rib.  A
 similar opacity is seen to be present on prior films dating back to [**2118-5-28**], and is probably related to the external portion of the catheter.  The
 lungs otherwise demonstrate no focal areas of consolidation and no pleural
 effusions are identified.

 IMPRESSION:  Focal opacity adjacent to external portion of right-sided
 vascular catheter, which is likely an external structure related to the
 catheter. However, given the history of fever and neutropenia, either
 additional oblique portable radiographs or a PA & lateral chest radiograph
 would be helpful to fully exclude an underlying lung abnormality in this
 region.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CHEST, 2 VIEWS [**2118-7-14**].

 Compared to previous radiograph of 2 days earlier.

 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Persistent fever.  Focal opacity on portable chest x-
 ray.

 Comparison is made to the recent portable chest radiograph of [**2118-7-12**],
 multiple prior radiographs dating back to [**2118-4-20**].  The heart size,
 mediastinal and hilar contours are within normal limits and stable.  Again
 demonstrated is a focal, sharply marginated opacity adjacent to the external
 portion of the right internal jugular catheter at approximately the fourth
 anterior rib level.  Review of multiple prior films demostrates a similar
 opacity since the time of placement of the catheter and there is no visible
 opacity in this region within the lung on the lateral view. These findings
 favor that the observed opacity is related to the catheter. The lungs appear
 grossly clear.  No pleural effusions are identified.

 IMPRESSION:  Focal opacity adjacent to catheter appears to be related to the
 catheter rather than due to a lung opacification.

Allergies:
Gluten / Betalactams / Vancomycin Hcl

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 7591**]
Chief Complaint:
54 year-old male with an enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma,
status post hyper CVAD therapy and 5 cycles of CHOP, and
recently ICE chemotherapy and collection, being admitted for
auto-BMT.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy ([**2118-7-12**])

History of Present Illness:
54 year-old male with an enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma
diagnosed in [**2115**], with known gastric and jejunal ulcers and
history of small bowel resection for microperforation, admitted
for auto-BMT on [**2118-6-17**]. He was previously treated with
hyper-CVAD (did not tolerate) and 5 cycles of CHOP. His course
was complicated by a bout of hepatitis in [**2118-4-19**] which was
felt to be chemical in etiology and led to weight loss, sprue
exacerbation and relapse. Following his bout of hepatitis, Mr.
[**Known lastname 45745**] was started back on TPN and has been doing well on it. He
was recently teated with a cycle of ICE chemotherapy and
collected in preparation for auto-BMT.

His bone marrow performed at the beginning of [**Month (only) **] revealed some
minimal involvement with his T-cell lymphoma. His liver biopsy
performed on [**2118-4-28**] revealed numerous apoptotic hepatocytes,
multiple small foci of sinusoidal mononuclear inflammation and
enlarged Kupffer cells consistent with acute hepatitis. No
neoplastic cells. Tissue EGD performed on [**2118-5-12**] showed some
involvement by enteropathy associated T-cell lymphoma in one
biopsy section.

Past Medical History:
1. Sprue:  Diagnosis [**9-20**], which was refractory to gluten-free
diet at which point prednisone therapy was initiated.  Further
investigation led to biopsy of small bowel and the diagnosis of
T cell lymphoma was made.

2. T cell Lymphoma:  As per HPI.

3. Transaminitis:  From [**Date range (1) 45746**] (peak AST 198, ALT 247, alk
phos 1062, negative HAV, HBV, HCV, HIV, CMV, toxo, VZV, HSV1,
HSV2).  Thought to be secondary to chemo and/or TPN.  Liver bx
revealed non-specific inflammation consistent with acute
hepatitis.

Social History:
Mr. [**Known lastname 45745**] lives with his wife, a nurse. [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 42866**] 1 pack of
cigarettes per day, denies alcohol or illicit drug use.

Family History:
Mother with breast cancer. His father died of an unknown cardiac
event at the age 34. Mother, sister and grandmother have
diabetes mellitus.


Physical Exam:
On admission: Temperature 97.9, HR 80, RR 20, BP 86-98/50-64.

elevated alkaline phosphatase on admission at 124, transaminases
within normal limits (ALT-9, AST-15, TOT BILI-0.1). Normal
coagulation profile.

Urinalysis negative

[**2118-5-31**] CMV IgG and IgM negative


Brief Hospital Course:
His hospital course will be reviewed by problems:

1) Enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma: He received Ara-C and
Etoposide (day -6 to -3) and melphalan (day -2) as part of the
BEAM protocol, followed by a rest day. Reinfusion was done on
[**2118-6-24**], which was well tolerated. His period of neutropenia
extended from [**2118-6-27**] to [**2118-7-7**], at which time his ANC was
back up to 2230. He had evidence of only mild oropharyngeal
mucositis which was treated with Peridex and Nystatin.

On [**2118-7-15**], Mr. [**Known lastname 45745**] had an acute transfusion reaction to
platelets, with hypotension, diffuse dermal edema and
periorbital edema, currently under investigation. He received
Solumedrol IV and Pepcid IV with symptomatic relief.
Premedication changed to Hydrocortisone 100 mg IV, Benadryl 50
mg IV, Pecid 20 mg IV, Tylenol 500-650 mg PO.

2) ID: Mr [**Known lastname 45745**] had an isolated temperature spike on [**2118-6-21**]
(day -3), at which time he was started on Vancomycin and
Levoquin (latter to be started as part of the protocol on
[**2118-6-22**]). He quickly defervesced, but developed a diffuse
maculopapular rash on [**2118-6-23**], at which time Vanco was D/C'd as
it was felt to be a possible culprit. Cultures from that time
were negative. He became febrile again on [**2118-6-30**], at which
time Vanco and Cefepime were started, and Levoquin was
discontinued. He remained persistently febrile and an antifungal
was added, along with Flagyl for a history of diarrhea
(eventually C. difficile negative). His rash persisted, and
decision was taken to D/C Cefepime (query contribution to
persistent rash) and start Aztreonam. Given worsening of the
rash with periorbital edema and query contribution to the fever,
along with possibility of drug fever, all antibiotics were
stopped on [**2118-7-6**] and he received 1 dose of Solumedrol. He
defervesced for 24 hours, then his temperature rose again. He
was restarted on Flagyl and Levo on [**2118-7-9**]. Ambisome was added
on [**7-10**] secondary to a finding of pulmonary nodules on CT scan,
however pulmonary did not feel these were significant, and
ambisome was d/c'ed on [**7-16**] since the patient was not
neutopenic. His temperature reached a peak to 104.6 on [**2118-7-10**].
CT chest on [**2118-7-10**] revealed multiple small non-specific
nodules, felt by pulmonary to be non-significant. CT abdomen and
pelvis negative on [**2118-7-10**]. Aztreonam was added to the regimen
on [**7-11**]. ID was consulted, and antibiotics were changed to
Meropenem and Flagyl, and continue Acyclovir. Daptomycin was
added on [**2118-7-12**] given persistent fever and desire to broaden
gram positive coverage (Vancomycin was felt to be a potential
culprit in the rash). All cultures negative thus far except for
a single bottle positive for Corynebacterium on [**2118-6-30**] felt to
be a contaminant. An MRI of the liver done on [**2118-7-13**] was
negative for hepatic candidiasis. Stool cultures were negative.
Repeat CMV negative. He defervesced on the above regimen. His
last temperature spike was on [**7-13**]. On [**7-18**] meropenem and
flagyl were discontinued, with no further fever spikes.  He will
be discharged on acyclovir, and nystatin swish and swallow.

3) GI: On [**2118-7-8**], Mr. [**Known lastname 45745**] had a Hct drop from 27 to 21 with
frankly guaiac positive stools. The source was felt most likely
to be upper GI. He was seen by GI, who was reluctant to perform
a scope given the patient's low platelets and leukopenia,
although ANC > 500. Decision was taken to treat conservatively,
with blood product support. On [**2118-7-11**], his Hct dropped again
from 29 to 21.8 with persistent melanotic stools and he was
transferred to the ICU. An EGD was performed on [**2118-7-12**], which
revealed ulceration in D3 consistent with an area of ulcerative
duodenitis without active bleeding. The EGD was otherwise normal
to D2. Pill endoscopy was considered but cancelled given a prior
history of small bowel stricture. The bleeding was also not
significant enought for a tagged RBC scan. He received a total
of 6 units PRBCs in the ICU, and 4 units of platelets. He was
transferred back to the floor on [**2118-7-14**]. His Hct has remained
stable since transfer, without further melena. Protonix IV
changed to PO BID on [**2118-7-16**], which he will be discharged on.

4) Rash: History as above in ID section. He developed a diffuse
maculopapular rash on [**2118-6-23**], which changed to a diffuse
blanching erythematous rash on [**2118-7-6**] and persisted. He also
developped some periorbital edema on [**2118-7-6**] and received a
dose of Solumedrol. Dermatology was consulted, with an
impression of erythroderma. Levoquin, Cefepime and Vancomycin
considered potential culprits and to be avoided. He was treated
symptomatically with Triamcinolone, and the rash resolved.

5) FEN:  Mr. [**Known lastname 45745**] was given TPN while he was here, in addition
to being encouraged to eat.  He will go home with TPN cycled
over 10 hours at night, and encouraged to eat a gluten free
diet.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Bacteremic, evaluate for abscess.

 TECHNIQUE:  CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained with 5 mm slice
 thickness after the administration of oral and intravenous contrast.
 Multiplanar reconstructions were obtained.  No priors.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  Moderate to large bilateral pleural effusions
 are identified, right greater than left, with bibasilar atelectasis.  The
 heart size is normal, and there is no evidence of pericardial effusion.

 Within the liver, a nonspecific, subcentimeter, hypodense area is seen within
 the right lobe (series 2, image 24), measuring approximately 8 mm, too small
 to characterize. The liver is otherwise unremarkable.  The portal vein is
 patent. The spleen, kidneys, adrenals and pancreas appear normal.

 Gallstones are noted, measuring approximately 9 mm.  The gallbladder wall is
 thickened, measuring approximately 11 mm, although it is not completely
 distended.  No pericholecystic fluid is identified. There is non-continuous
 mucosal enhancement within the gallbladder, which may be seen with gangrenous
 cholecystitis.  Gallbladder ultrasound and clinical correlation is advised.

 Trace perihepatic ascites is noted.

 CT PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  A tiny bubble of gas is seen within the urinary
 bladder, presumably from prior Foley catheterization.  The prostate and
 seminal vesicles appear normal.

 The colon appears normal, without evidence of diverticulosis or
 diverticulitis.  Trace free fluid is seen within the left pericolic gutter,
 though the adjacent loops of colon appear normal.

 BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious bony lesions.  Degenerative changes are seen
 within the spine.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Gallstones with gallbladder wall edema and non-continuous mucosal
 enhancement.  CLinical correlation and right upper quadrant ultrasound is
 advised to exclude cholecystitis.

Brief Hospital Course:
Brief [**Hospital **] Hospital Course is outlined below:

1) Enterobacter bacteremia: The patient was initially admitted
to the ICU on the MUST protocol based on a lactate of 4.4. He
was mildly hypotensive and febrile to 101.4. He was aggressively
hydrated with IVF and empirically initiated on amp/gent. He was
briefly placed on levophed/vasopressin pressors but was able to
be weaned off by his second hospital day. Blood cultures from
admission grew enterobacter in [**5-15**] bottles, pan sensitive. In
addition cultures were positive for yeast, unspeciated upon
discharge. Fluconazole was added to his regimen and ampicillin
was discontinued. The source of his infection was unclear,
although urine source was suspected given dirty urine on
admission. Admission urinalysis showed >50 RBCs, >50 WBC's and
moderate leukocytes, although urine cultures were negative. The
patient was transferred to the medicine service on [**2-17**], hospital
day #3. ID was consulted and recommended a switch to levaquin
based on culture sensitivities. Flagyl was also added for
empiric GI coverage pending further evaluation. CT abdomen was
performed and demonstrated no evidence of abscess or bowel
pathology. There was mention of gallstones and gallbladder wall
thickening suspicious for cholecystitis. However the patient
remained afebrile with no abdominal pains and normal liver
function tests. Given his clinical stability with maintenance of
his blood pressure off IVF, tolerance of PO intake, and absence
of fever, he was discharged to home on [**2-19**]. He was discharged
home on PO levaquin and PO fluconazole for a 14 day course based
on ID recommendations. Flagyl was discontinued. He will
follow-up with his PCP [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] [**2-12**] weeks.

2) Rheumatoid arthritis- previoiusly on plaquenil, so relatively
immunosuppressed. Granulocyte count on admission= 1680, so he
was not neutropenic. He was re-started on plaquenil after he was
clinically stable.

3) Anemia: secondary to SLE likely. Goal HCT>27. Hct remained
>30 through his hospital course. Initital decrease in hematocrit
was likely secondary to IVF hydration.

4) Edema: Noted peripheral edema following IVF hydration. He was
also noted to have bilateral pleural effusions by CT scan, also
likely secondary to aggressive fluid resuscitation. He was not
started on lasix since he was able to autodiurese well, with >2
liters off over the last 24 hours prior to discharge.

5) Mental status change: Initially delirious on admission,
likely secondary to his underlying infection. Once infection
cleared his mental status improved back to baseline. No further
evaluation was performed.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 11040**]
Chief Complaint:
right hip pain, fall

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Intubation


History of Present Illness:
This is a 88 year-old man with dementia, COPD, CHF,
osteoarthritis s/p L hip replacement and h/o TIA who presented
to the ED after a fall. In the ED, he was initially stable, but
he began to become increasingly agitated and aggressive. He
received haloperidol and ativan, but remained combative. His O2
sats never dipped below 90% but he became even more agitated,
diaphoretic and, after discussion with the pt's daughter, the
decision was made to intubate him so a w/u of his fall could be
undertaken.

There was some concern about O2 sats in the low 90s, and after a
d-dimer returned at 1000, a CTPA was done. It was negative. A
head CT revealed no acute change. Hip films revealed.

He was admitted to the ICU intubated.

Brief Hospital Course:
This is a 88 year-old man with history of dementia, COPD and CHF
(EF unknown) who presented from his nursing home after falling
and having some right-sided weakness. In the ED, he became
agitated and combative and was intubated for workup.

## Agitation, intubation: CTA revealed no avute pathology. He
was extubated without difficulty.

## s/p fall: Hip films and CT head were unremarkable. Likely
mechanical fall. No events on telemetry.

## COPD: Extent of COPD unknown. Takes no meds at baseline.
Reason for intubation was not hypoxia.

## Cardiomyopathy: presumed ischemic in nature. Unknown EF, but
BNP <100 suggested no significant volume overload. He was
continued on atorvastatin 10.

 TECHNIQUE:  AP, lateral, and frog leg lateral views of the right hip were
 obtained and submitted for interpretation.  No prior examinations are
 available for direct comparison.

 FINDINGS:  AP view of the pelvis demonstrate that the patient is status post
 left total hip replacement with cemented arthroplasty of the long stem
 component.  The femoral head is well seated within the acetabular component.
 There is no evidence of a loosening or fracture of the prosthesis.  There is,
 however, erosion and degenerative change along the lateral aspect of the left
 iliac [**Doctor First Name 1829**], compatible with ossific bodies and degeneration.  No particle
 disease is appreciated.

 Evaluation of the right hip demonstrates mild superior lateral narrowing of
 the right hip, compatible with osteoarthritis.  There are ring-like
 osteophytes surrounding the right femoral neck.  No fracture or dislocation is
 seen.  The evaluation of the acetabulum demonstrates no fracture either.

 The remainder of the pelvis demonstrates no evidence for acute fracture or
 dislocation.  Mild degenerative changes of the lumbosacral spine are
 appreciated.

 IMPRESSION:

 No acute fracture or dislocation of right hip. Consider MRI if symptoms
 persist.

Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

A central line catheter tip is seen in the right atrium in close proximity to
the tricuspid annulus.
LEFT ATRIUM: The left atrium is normal in size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: The right atrium is normal in size. A
catheter or pacing wire is seen in the right atrium and/or right ventricle.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal. There is no resting left ventricular outflow tract obstruction.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

AORTIC VALVE: The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.

MITRAL VALVE: The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. The mitral
regurgitation jet is eccentric.

TRICUSPID VALVE: The tricuspid valve leaflets are normal. Mild tricuspid [1+]
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: The pulmonic valve leaflets appear
structurally normal. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is seen.

PERICARDIUM: There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Based on [**2137**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations,
the echo findings indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended). Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and
echocardiographic data. The echocardiographic results were reviewed with the
houseofficer caring for the patient. A right pleural effusion is present.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. The posterior mitral valve
leaflet is mildly thickened with ?prolapse of the posterior leaflet. There is
an eccentric, anteriorly directed jet of at least mild-moderate mitral
regurgitation. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension with
significant pulmonic regurgitation. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial
effusion.

IMPRESSION: Thickened posterior mitral leaflet with ?prolapse and at least
mild-moderate mitral regurgitation c/w possible endocarditis. Preserved
biventricular systolic function. Pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
If clinically indicated, a TEE would be better able to define the mitral valve
morphology and to assess for a possible perivalvular abscess (none suggested
on TTE).

Based on [**2137**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings
indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended). Clinical decisions
regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and
echocardiographic data.

 (1) The foci described in the [**2143-3-10**] report are not seen on diffusion images
 which excludes acute infarcts from septic emboli as a cause.
 (2) No abnormal enhnacement was seen on initial MR of [**2143-3-4**].
 (3) Subtle increased signal seen in right temporal region could be within the
 sulcus. Similar but less apparent abnormality is also seen along a sulcus in
 left occipital region. These findings could be due to high protein content of
 CSF. Please correlate with CSF findings.

 Given the non-specific nature of these abnormalities, I am unable to offer a
 firm diagnosis. I would suggest a follow up scan with gadolinium to see
 progression/regression of signal changes or new areas of enhancement.

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  patient with MSSA endocarditis and renal infarction,
 persistent fever and pheocytosis in the CSF.  Rule out microtic aneurysm.

 TECHNIQUE:  T1 sagittal and axial, FLAIR, T2 and susceptibility axial images
 of the brain were obtained.  Diffusion axial images were also acquired.  3D
 TOF MRA of the circle was obtained.

 FINDINGS:  Comparison was made to the previous study of [**2143-3-4**].

 BRAIN MRI:  Subtle areas of increased signal are identified in the left
 frontal, right posterior temporal and right cerebellar regions which are
 unchanged from the previous study.  No evidence of midline shift, mass effect
 or hydrocephalus is identified.  No definite evidence of restricted diffusion
 is seen to indicate acute infarct.  The left frontal and right cerebellar
 regions demonstrate increased signal and diffusion images most likely
 secondary to T2 shine through.  No evidence of ventriculomegaly or mass effect
 is seen.  No evidence of brain edema is noted.

 IMPRESSION:  Small foci of signal abnormalities in the right temporal, right
 cerebellar and left frontal regions are unchanged from the previous study.  No
 evidence of mass effect or midline shift.

 MRA OF THE HEAD:  The MRA of the circle of [**Known lastname **] demonstrates no evidence of
 vascular occlusion, stenosis or aneurysm greater than 3 mm in size in the
 arteries surrounding the circle of [**Known lastname **].  Incidentally noted is vascular
 lobe extending to the medial portion of the right internal auditory canal
 probably representing the anterior inferior cerebellar artery which could be a
 normal variation.

 IMPRESSION:  No significant abnormalities detected within the MRA of the head.

systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and
free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally
normal with good leaflet excursion and trace aortic regurgitation. The mitral
valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is a moderate-sized about 1.3 cm
long)vegetation on the posterior mitral valve leaflet. Moderate (2+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric (anteriorly
directed). There is mild to moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is a very small pericardial effusion. There are no echocardiographic
signs of tamponade.

Compared with the prior study of [**2143-3-4**], the vegetation appears similar in
size. Mitral regurgitation appears similar. (The severity of mitral
regurgitation was probably underestimated in the transesophageal study of
[**2143-3-5**] because views were technically suboptimal.) Trace aortic regurgitation
may also have been present in the prior study (views suboptimal). The
pericardial effusion is similar in size. Estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is similar.

Date of Birth:   [**2116-6-27**]       Sex:  F

Service:  ACOVE

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Fever.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 26-year-old
woman with a history of IV drug abuse, who initially
presented to an outside hospital on [**2143-3-2**] from a
drug and detoxification facility with a chief complaint of
headache, abdominal pain, and fever.  At the outside
hospital, the patient was found to be febrile to 104.6
degrees F, and she subsequently developed hypotension with a
systolic blood pressure in the 80s.

During this initial evaluation, the patient was confused and
only intermittently answering questions.  There was concern
for possible headache, neck stiffness, and photophobia, so
given the concern for meningitis, a spinal tap was done.
This study demonstrated 50 white blood cells (84%
neutrophils), 10 red blood cells, protein of 23, glucose of
86, and 0-5 yeast per high power field.  Given these findings
and concern for meningitis, the patient received Vancomycin,
ceftriaxone, metronidazole, and gentamicin at the outside
hospital.  Given the lack of Intensive Care Unit beds at the
outside hospital, the patient was therefore transferred to
the [**Hospital1 69**] for further
evaluation.

On arrival to the Emergency Department at the [**Hospital1 346**], the patient was found to have
icteric sclerae, a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur, abdominal
guarding, and right upper quadrant tenderness.  Given the
concern for an abdominal process, the patient was given
levofloxacin and metronidazole; she was also given Ambisome
given the finding of yeast in her CSF at the outside
hospital.

In the Emergency Department, she had an abdominal ultrasound
that was negative for the presence of gallbladder or ductal
dilatation.  Also at this time, the patient began to deny the
report that she was HIV positive; this report has been
obtained only by report and not by documented laboratory
testing from the outside hospital.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Intravenous drug abuse.
2. Cholelithiasis.
3. Cholecystectomy.
4. Spontaneous abortion x2.
5. Therapeutic abortion x1.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  None.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a single mother of three
children ages 9, 8, and 2 years old.  She is unemployed.  She
last used heroin 3-4 days prior to admission; she began using
heroin one year prior to admission.  The patient smokes a
third of a pack of cigarettes a day and denies any history of
alcohol abuse.  She denies any history of providing sexual
favors for drugs or money.  She says her only lifetime
partner is her husband.

INITIAL PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 97.6, heart rate
95, blood pressure 113/71, respiratory rate 20, and oxygen
saturation 100% on room air.  During this initial evaluation,
the patient was not reliable as a historian.  She appeared to
be a well dressed well-nourished female in moderate distress
from ""not feeling well"", lying in bed, and subsequently
having emesis x1.  HEENT exam:  Extraocular movements are
intact.  There was mild scleral icterus.  Mild conjunctival
edema.  Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light.
There were small conjunctival hemorrhages on the right
greater than on the left.  Her face was symmetric.  Her neck
was stiff with pain with flexion half-way down towards the
chest.  The right IJ central venous catheter was in place.  A
small posterior cervical lymph node is palpable.  Her
oropharyngeal examination was remarkable for upper dentures
with eroded mucosa and white plaques consistent with thrush
underneath.  Her tongue was coated with a whitish film, and
she had a few petechiae on her upper palate.  Her heart was
regular, rate, and rhythm, and there was a [**3-28**] holosystolic
murmur throughout the precordium that radiated to the axilla.
Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  Her
abdomen was soft, there were normoactive bowel sounds, she
had bilateral upper quadrant guarding, and mild abdominal
distention.  The patient notes that her abdominal discomfort
has been present for the past five months.  She had bilateral
upper extremity tract marks in her right forearm and in her
bilateral antecubital fossa that were clean.  Scattered dark
macules were seen on her palms bilaterally.  She had mild,
but not true CMT on pelvic examination.  She was moving all
extremities freely and equally and had full strength on
neurologic examination.

Her laboratories from the outside hospital included the
following:  Urinalysis was essentially negative.  One out of
two blood culture bottles were growing gram-positive cocci in
clusters initially.  Her CSF demonstrated 0-4 neutrophils and
0-5 yeasts per high power field, 10 red blood cells, 50 white
cells (80% neutrophils, 3% lymphocytes, 13% monocytes), 23
protein, and 86 glucose.  Her complete blood count showed a
white count of 13.3, hematocrit 35.5, and platelets 110,000.
Differential for white count demonstrated 77 neutrophils, 14%
bands, 2% lymphocytes, and 6% monocytes.  Her INR was 1.28
and her PTT was 49.  Serum chemistries demonstrated a sodium
of 133, bicarbonate 21, BUN 34, creatinine 2.0.  Of note, her
creatinine was 0.5 in [**2143-1-23**].  Her total bilirubin
is 3, direct bilirubin 2.3, ALT 967, AST 396, GGT 125,
alkaline phosphatase 156; her LFTs had been normal at
baseline one month prior.

Her electrocardiogram at the outside hospital demonstrated
sinus tachycardia at 112 beats per minute, normal axis, and
normal intervals.

Her head CT scan from the outside hospital demonstrated
motion artifact and normal volumes to the ventricles.  An
abdominal ultrasound demonstrated increased echotexture to
the bilateral kidneys, and no evidence of hydronephrosis.

At the [**Hospital1 69**], her laboratories
demonstrated sodium 140, potassium 3.8, chloride 113,
bicarbonate 16, BUN 26, creatinine 1.5, and glucose of 204.
Her calcium was 5.8, magnesium 1.2, and phosphate 3.  Her
white count was 12.2, hematocrit 29.7, and platelets of
60,000.  Differential of her white count demonstrated 68%
neutrophils, 19% bands, 9% lymphocytes, and 4% monocytes.
Her fibrinogen was 477, FDP 10-40, and D dimer was pending.
Her ALT was 529, AST 150, alkaline phosphatase 97, amylase
46, lipase 23, and albumin 2.3.  Her urinalysis had greater
than 50 red blood cells, [**7-2**] white blood cells, and
leukocyte esterase and nitrate were negative.  Her PTT was
36.7 and her INR of 1.6.

Her abdominal ultrasound demonstrated minimal new
intrahepatic ductal dilatation and small pneumobilia.  A HIV
test was done on admission to the [**Hospital1 190**] and was pending.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEMS:
1. Infectious Diseases:  While the patient was reported to be
HIV positive upon her arrival to the Emergency Department at
the [**Hospital1 69**], her HIV test
subsequently returned negative.  She also informed her
caretakers that she had multiple HIV tests in the past, all
of which had been negative.

The report of ""yeast"" found in her CSF at the OSH was also
found to be false-positive.  No yeast or fungal organisms
grew out the culture of her CSF, and a CSF Gram stain was
repeated twice at the outside hospital and found to be
negative both times.  The patient received several doses of
Ambisome at the [**Hospital1 69**], but
once it had been confirmed that the finding of yeast was a
false-positive, her Ambisome was discontinued.

By hospital day three, the gram-positive cocci in clusters
that ultimately grew out from [**2-26**] blood culture bottles at
the outside hospital had been speciated as
methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA).  Once
this definitive speciation was made, the patient's antibiotic
regimen was tailored to include oxacillin and gentamicin; the
gentamicin was used for only four days in order to aid in the
clearance of her bacteremia.  Given the finding of this
bacteremia and her alarming concert of symptoms on admission,
a transthoracic echocardiogram was performed on hospital day
two.

This study demonstrated a thickened posterior mitral leaflet
with a question of prolapse and at least mild-to-moderate
mitral regurgitation consistent with possible endocarditis.
Biventricular systolic function was preserved.  Pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension was seen.  Given these findings,
a transesophageal echocardiogram was performed on hospital
day three.  This study demonstrated a moderate sized mitral
valve vegetation consistent with a diagnosis of bacterial
endocarditis.

Given this finding, it was felt that all of the patient's
initial signs and symptoms were consistent with bacterial
endocarditis.  Given that the finding of yeast in the CSF was
found to be a false-positive, and given that all subsequent
Gram stain and culture data from the CSF remained negative,
the patient was not felt to have had bacterial meningitis at
any point (of note, two colonies of gram-positive cocci in
clusters were isolated from the patient's CSF culture;
however, these colonies were subsequently speciated as
coag-negative Staph, and were therefore thought to be a
contaminate.

Given the patient's LFTs abnormalities on admission, an
abdominal CT scan was done on hospital day two.  This study
demonstrated a focal area of low attenuation in the contrast
enhanced right kidney, that was ultimately attributed to a
septic embolus to the right kidney.  Also seen were large
bilateral pleural effusions with compressive atelectasis,
ascites, and free abdominal fluid, and a large amount of
pelvic fluid.  These fluid collections were all thought to be
secondary to a systemic inflammatory response syndrome
secondary to the patient's underlying bacterial endocarditis.

In order to rule out the possibility of an epidural abscess,
a spinal MRI was done on hospital day four.  This study
demonstrated no evidence of epidural abscess.  Also of note,
a MRI of the head had been done on hospital day two in order
to further evaluate for the possibility of meningeal
inflammation.  This study did not demonstrate any definite
evidence of a focal lesion in the third ventricle or a focal
mass within the brain.

Following the initiation of the appropriate antibiotic
therapy as noted above, the patient slowly began to improve
clinically.  She initially continued to spike high fevers,
but she gradually defervesced.  Her white count also
initially remained elevated, but this too gradually began to
trend down while on appropriate antibiotics.  She did develop
reactive arthridities in both her left ankle and her left
hand.  The Department of Rheumatology was consulted given
these reactive arthridities and recommended supportive care
to the area.

The patient's LFTs abnormalities present on admission
gradually normalized.  Of note, however, the patient did
develop mild elevations in her alkaline phosphatase, amylase,
and lipase following the initiation of oxacillin therapy.  It
was thought that these elevations may have been secondary to
oxacillin, but the elevations did not persist and had begun
to trend towards normal at the time of discharge.  Given
these normalizations, and given that the patient's hematocrit
had been remaining stable (thus indicating that there was no
significant myelosuppression as a result of oxacillin
therapy), the patient was discharged with a plan for six
weeks of continued oxacillin therapy.

In order to rule out the possibility of mycotic aneurysm in
the brain, a MRI of the head was obtained on hospital day
seven.  This study demonstrated no evidence of acute infarct
from septic emboli, and a subtle increased signal in the
right temporal region that could be within the sulcus.  A
similar, but less apparent abnormality was also seen along
the sulcus of the left occipital region.  These abnormalities
were nonspecific in nature, but were thought to possibly have
been due to a high protein content of the CSF.  Given the
patient's overall clinical stability, however, the decision
was made to clinically follow the patient as an outpatient
following her discharge from the hospital.

Also of note, the patient had a cervical chlamydia probe
return positive during this hospitalization.  She received
azithromycin 1,000 mg once during her hospitalization for
treatment of this chlamydia.

2. Cardiovascular:  Given that the patient had significant
endocarditis, a Cardiology consult was obtained early in the
patient's hospitalization for evaluation of whether or not
the patient was a surgical candidate for her endocarditis.
Given that the patient did not have clinically significant
congestive heart failure or valvular dysfunction with
persistent infection after 7-10 days of appropriate
antibiotics, the patient was deemed not to be a surgical
candidate.  She subsequently developed no significant
congestive heart failure, and she had no further embolic
phenomena following the septic embolus sheath to her right
kidney.

Given her bilateral pleural effusions and mitral
regurgitation, the patient was transiently on furosemide
during this hospitalization, but had no signs or symptoms of
congestive heart failure at the time of her discharge from
the hospital.

3. Rheumatology:  As noted above, the patient initially
developed a left ankle reactive arthritis on hospital day
six.  Given the asymmetric edema in her left ankle, a
Rheumatology consult was obtained.  The Rheumatology service
agreed that the swelling in her left ankle was reactive
arthritis.  The patient subsequently developed left hand
swelling later in her hospitalization, at which point the
Rheumatology service was reconsulted.  They again felt that
the swelling in the patient's left hand was due to a reactive
arthritis that would be best managed with supportive care.
She was started on a 14 day course of naproxen for treatment
of the inflammation and swelling in her hand.

By the time of discharge, the patient's swelling in both her
left hand and her left ankle had improved dramatically, and
were nearly at their baseline.

4. Hematology:  Soonafter admission, the patient manifested a
significant anemia with a hematocrit in the low 20s.  The
etiology of this anemia was ultimately thought to be
multifactorial due to a combination of anemia of chronic
disease, recurrent phlebotomy, menstruation, and oxacillin
induced myelosuppression.  There was no evidence of hemolysis
either by laboratory evaluation or by direct evaluation of
the peripheral smear.  Given that the patient's hematocrit
was low, she was started on iron supplementation during this
hospitalization.

At the time of discharge, however, the patient's hematocrit
had been consistently stable for over one week, and the
decision was made to continue her on oxacillin for the time
being with twice weekly hematocrits following her discharge
from the hospital.

5. Psychiatry:  By hospital day eight, the patient began
threatening to leave the hospital against medical advice due
to inadequate pain control.  Given the concern for the
patient possibly leaving the hospital against medical advice
without plans for continued intravenous antibiotics, a
Psychiatry consult was requested.  The Psychiatry service
felt that the patient had poor coping mechanisms given the
severity of her illness, and recommended initiation of an
atypical antipsychotic.  In addition, they recommended
analgesia as necessary, including with narcotic medications
if necessary, in order to adequately control the patient's
pain.  The patient was subsequently started on an atypical
antipsychotic, and her narcotic medication dosing regimen was
increased, with excellent therapeutic affect.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Good.

DISCHARGE PLACEMENT:  [**Hospital **] Hospital.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis
complicated by right renal septic embolus.
2. Chlamydia.
3. Systemic inflammatory response syndrome.
4. Multifactorial anemia.
5. Reactive arthritis.
6. Intravenous drug abuse.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Oxacillin 2 grams IV q4h through [**2143-4-15**].
2. Naproxen 500 mg po bid through [**2143-3-29**].
3. Pantoprazole 40 mg po q day.
4. Ferrous sulfate 325 mg po q day.
5. Quetiapine 25 mg po tid.
6. Hydromorphone 1 mg IV q4h prn pain.

FOLLOWUP:
1. The patient should have her hematocrit, alkaline
phosphatase, amylase, and lipase all checked twice a week
while at [**Hospital1 **].  The results of these blood tests should
be faxed to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2504**] at fax #[**Telephone/Fax (1) 1419**] in the
Department of Infectious Diseases at [**Hospital1 190**].
2. The patient should arrange for a follow-up appointment
with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2504**] by calling [**Telephone/Fax (1) 457**].  She should
arrange for this appointment during the week after she leaves
[**Hospital1 **].
3. The patient should call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 250**] to arrange for a
follow-up appointment with Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 2505**] during the week
following her release from [**Hospital1 **].
4. Note that the patient should receive the hepatitis A and
hepatitis B virus vaccines as an outpatient.

 INDICATION:  Trauma.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast axial images through the brain.

 CT HEAD W/O CONTRAST:  High attenuation material is seen along both frontal
 lobes, in one area is slightly linticular in shape.  There are scattered high
 attenuation foci within both adjacent frontal lobes, with surrounding low
 attenuation rims.  In addition, there is a small amount of subarachnoid
 hemorrhage within the right sylvian fissure and a few scattered right frontal
 sulci.  The ventricles, basal cisterns are otherwise unremarkable.  The
 frontal sulci are effaced.  It is difficult to get an accurate measurement of
 the thickness of this extra-axial collection due to volume averaging.  There
 is a parasagittal fracture running along the midline of the high cranium and
 extending down along the left frontal bone into the left orbital roof.  The
 fracture extends posteriorly through the right occipital bone. There
 is polypoid mucosal thickening/retention cyst in the left maxillary sinus, and
 possible fluid level seen in the right maxillary sinus.

 IMPRESSION:  Bifrontal contusion, with subarachnoid hemorrhage.  There is also
 acute extra-axial collection which is difficult to determine if this  is
 subdural or epidural space.  There is either bifrontal subdural collections or
 an epidural collection crossing the midline (involving the venous sinus).
 Associated skull fracture, as described above.

 HISTORY:  Struck by car with frontal hemorrhage.  Evaluate for interval
 change.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan.

 FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior day's study of [**8-10**], there is increasing
 size of the epidural hemorrhage, with a slightly greater size component
 anterior to the right frontal pole.  However, there does not appear to be
 appreciable change in mass effect, as evidenced by any alteration in
 ventricular configuration in the area of the frontal horns.  The extensive
 bifrontal contusions are redemonstrated.  The subarachnoid hemorrhage is less
 conspicuous at this time.  The large left frontal skull fracture extending to
 the sagittal suture is seen, as well as a small right parietal vertex
 fracture.  There is a stellate fracture involving the occipital bone on the
 right side.

 CONCLUSION:  Slight increase in size of frontal epidural hemorrhage, now with
 a right-sided component. The surgical team caring for this patient was
 notified by phone.

 Fracture involving the occipital bone on the right side.

 There is a probable 2-cm retention cyst seen in the visualized superior aspect
 of the left maxillary sinus.  The cyst may be larger as the sinuses are
 incompletely imaged.  There is mild mucosal thickening along the anterior wall
 of the right sphenoid air cell.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 25-year-old male
pedestrian struck by a car while walking across the street
and thrown 10 feet.  He was found unresponsive at the scene
with a GCS of 8.  He became combative in the ambulance and
was taken to [**Hospital6 5016**].  He was hemodynamically
stable.  At [**Hospital6 5016**], the patient was found to
have a subarachnoid hemorrhage on head CT along with a large
skull fracture.  He was seen by Neurosurgery at [**Hospital6 10443**] but his family requested transfer to [**Hospital6 1760**].

At the outside hospital, the patient received 2 mg of Ativan
and mannitol and a question of Dilantin for his head injury.
On arrival, the patient was hemodynamically stable with a GCS
of 14, slightly agitated, but stable.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  None.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

ALLERGIES:  None.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Weekend use of alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Vital signs:  GCS 14.  Alert and
oriented times one.  Vitals:  Temperature 97.2.  Heart rate
100.  Blood pressure 161/90.  Respiratory rate 14.  Oxygen
saturation 100% on four liters.  Physical examination:
Pupils equal, round and reactive to light.  Extraocular
movements intact.  Face was stable.  TMs were clear.  Neck:
Trachea was midline with no crepitus.  Mandible was stable.
His heart was regular rate and rhythm.  Chest was clear to
auscultation bilaterally with no crepitus.  Abdomen was soft,
nontender, nondistended and his fast exam was negative.
Rectal was normal tone, no gross blood, guaiac was negative.
Extremities without deformities.  Patient was moving all four
extremities.  His strength was equal throughout, as well as
his sensation and nonfocal neurological exam.  There was a
small laceration noted on the right occipital area of his
head.

LABORATORIES:  Patient had a normal hematocrit of 45.0.  He
also had normal coagulations with a PT of 13, PTT of 23 and
INR of 1.2.  Laboratories were also notable for an alcohol
level of 112 and a toxicology screen that was positive for
opiates and cocaine.

RADIOLOGY:  Chest x-ray and pelvis x-ray were negative.  CT
of the abdomen was negative.  CT of the C spine was negative
for fracture.  Plain films of the TLS spine were also
negative for fracture and stability.  CT of the head showed
orbital frontal contusions with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
There was extra-atrial blood noted with a question of left
epidural versus subdural hemorrhage and there was a large
associated parasagittal skull fracture running along the
midline of the cranium into the left orbital area.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Trauma
Surgical Intensive Care Unit for q. 1 hour neurological
checks, as well as for intravenous fluids.  The patient was
protecting his own airway, so intubation was not of concern.
The patient had an immediate consultation from Neurosurgery
who recommended that operative management would not be
necessary that it was sufficient to continue with the q. 1
hour neurological checks, as well as following the coags
every 4 hours, as well as to try to limit the amount of
sedation in order to not cloud the examination of medical
status.  The patient continued to remain agitative through
the first three hospital days requiring occasional use of
benzodiazepines and narcotics to relieve pain and agitation.

On hospital day number two, he received a repeat head CT,
which again demonstrated the parasagittal fracture, as well
as slight increase in the size of a frontal epidural
hemorrhage now with a right sided component.  While in the
Trauma Surgical Intensive Care Unit, the patient was also
started on Dilantin for seizure prophylaxis, as well as on
oxacillin for infectious prophylaxis of the open head wound.

On hospital day number four, the patient's mental status had
improved enough, to where his agitation had decreased
slightly allowing him to be transferred from the Trauma
Intensive Care Unit to the floor still under a 1:1 sitter due
to occasional agitation.  A Neurobehavioral consult was
obtained and per the recommendations of the Neurobehavioral
consult, the patient was removed from all sedating
medications aside from occasional Percocets for pain control
and instead was added Seroquel 25 q.p.m., as well as
trazodone 25 q.p.m. to repeat times one for helping the
patient sleep at night.

On hospital day number five, the patient was slightly
decreased in agitation in the morning, although, still
getting up out of bed and walking, even with a 1:1 sitter,
however, he continued to improve throughout the day clearing
his mental status, becoming alert and oriented times three
and becoming more aware of his surroundings.  In an attempt
to try to regulate his sleep cycles and decrease the morning
agitation, the trazodone was discontinued, but the Seroquel
was continued.  The morning of hospital day number six, the
patient showed a marked decrease in his agitation in the
morning, showing greater incite into his situation, not
getting out of bed on his own and being fully alert and
oriented.

Also, on hospital day number six, Occupational Therapy and
Physical Therapy, as well as Social Work were consulted.
Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy had helped the
patient work with his cognitive and functional deficits,
principally, his gait, which was still mostly ataxic six days
following his head injury.  Social Work was consulted
primarily for providing references for substance abuse
programs to deal with the patient's noted alcohol abuse.  The
patient continued to deny any us of opiates or cocaine,
although, did not remember if he had taken any substances the
night the injury was sustained, so the patient was referred
to substance abuse clinics for further follow-up for this.

On hospital day number six, it was determined that the
patient would be eligible for [**Hospital **] rehabilitation
inpatient therapy, so that several facilities were contact[**Name (NI) **]
and one facility determined that the patient would be
suitable for a rehabilitation stay there.  The patient was
stable enough for discharge to the rehabilitation facility
under constant 1:1 supervision to decrease any fall risk.
Thus, the patient was discharged to a neurological
rehabilitation facility on hospital day number six.

FINAL DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Pedestrian struck by car.
2.  Parasagittal skull fracture.
3.  Frontal lobe contusions.
4.  Bilateral epidural hemorrhages with result in cognitive
and functional disabilities.
5.  Substance abuse.

POST DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Dulcolax 5 mg 2 tablets q.d. as needed for constipation.
2.  Tylenol 650 mg q. 4-6 hours as needed for pain.
3.  Hydromorphone 10 mg, 1-2 tablets every 4 hours as needed
for pain.
4.  Seroquel 25 mg, 1 tablet q.p.m. times four weeks.
5.  Dicloxacillin 500 mg, 1 capsule po q. 6 hours times eight
days.

FOLLOW-UP:
1.  The patient will be followed up at the Rehabilitation
Facility by a physician to take out the staples and evaluate
the head wound in seven to ten days.
2.  Neurosurgery follow-up in three weeks with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**]
with a repeat CT prior to the appointment.
3.  Trauma Clinic in two weeks.
4.  Neurobehavioral follow-up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 51572**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] in one
month.
5.  Alcohol and other substance abuse.  Patient was provided
referrals for follow-up at each of these places.

 HEAD CT

 INDICATION: New lateral gaze palsy.  Assess for expanding hematoma.

 COMPARISON: [**2132-8-11**].

 TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT.

 FINDINGS: Bifrontal epidural hemorrhage is again noted, the right component of
 which is slightly increased in size in the interval. Since the previous exam,
 there has been slight decrease in attenuation of both frontal lobes
 inferiorly, consistent with progression of bifrontal contusion.  Slight mass
 effect is again exerted on the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 39**] of the right lateral ventricle,
 but this is unchanged in the interval.  There is no hydrocephalus or shift of
 the normally midline structures.  [**Doctor Last Name **]-white matter differentiation remains
 preserved.  Calvarial fracture is again noted, and skin staples are present
 within the right posterior scalp.

 IMPRESSION: Slight increase in size of right component of the bifrontal
 epidural hematoma.  Bifrontal contusions in evolution.  No appreciable change
 in degree of mass effect since the previous exam.  Findings discussed with
 [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 97886**] at the time of the interpretation.

ADDENDUM:  Over the final weekend prior to discharge, the
patient reported difficulty with vision as well as with smell
and taste.

For the visual difficulties, the patient said that
occasionally he had double vision but mostly his vision was
just blurry in the right eye, but with closing the right his
vision would improve.  He said this also partly effected the
way that he was walking and that his walking was better with
the right eye closed.

For the new reported visual changes, on physical examination,
showed a slight decrease in the later movement ability of the
right eye; consistent with a sixth nerve palsy.  The visual
fields were intact, however.

Given these new findings, a repeat head computed tomography
was ordered which showed no interval changes.  No effects of
the area in or around the orbit but still showing the
bilateral epidural hemorrhages and frontal edema.

Regarding the difficulties in smell and taste, over the
course of the weekend the patient did notice an improving
anosmia; which, per the behavioral neurologist, was
considered likely to improve over time.  For the anosmia,
which decreased the patient's appetite, they were
supplementing his diet with Boost drinks three times per day.

The patient had been on fluid restriction during her
hospitalization to reduce cerebral edema; as ordered by
Neurosurgery.  This restriction was safely discontinued prior
to his discharge to the rehabilitation facility.

The patient was re-evaluated for neurologic rehabilitation
centers after being rejected on the original day of discharge
and was approved by [**Hospital3 6841**] Clinic in [**Location (un) 5905**] for discharge to an inpatient setting on [**2132-8-20**].

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:  No changes made to medications on
discharge.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to the
[**Hospital3 6841**] Clinic.

 CT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST

 TECHNIQUE:  Helical scanning is performed from the diaphragm through the
 symphysis during dynamic injection of 150 cc of optiray.  Optiray was used due
 to patient request.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH IV CONTRAST:  A moderate right sided pleural effusion
 is identified and there is atelectasis at the right lung base. The liver is
 without focal lesions. The patient is s/p cholecystectomy.  A small hypodense
 lesion is identified within the spleen.  The adrenals are unremarkable. In the
 upper pole of the right kidney there is a 1.4 cm hypodense lesion. A similar
 lesion is noted in the upper pole of the left kidney.  These measure 21 and 33
 hounsfield units following the injection of IV contrast.  The pancreas is
 unremarkable. Fluid is noted surrounding the liver and mostly anterior to
 small bowel loops.  There is free intraperitoneal air in several locations
 anterior to the liver, in [**Location (un) 10527**] pouch as well as between the abdominal
 wall and the small bowel loops. A fluid/air collection is seen between the
 anterior abdominal wall and the small bowel loops displacing small bowel loops
 posteriorly.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  Small and large bowel appear unremarkable.
 Oral contrast is seen in the distal ileum.   There is fluid within the pelvis.
 The bladder appears unremarkable as does the prostate gland between the
 anterior abdominal wall and the small bowel loops.  No extravasation of oral
 contrast is noted. There are fluid collections within the anterior abdominal
 wall in the periumbilical region.  A second fluid collection containing air is
 noted in the left lateral abdominal wall and measures 3.6 x 9.6 cm.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. Large amount of free intraperitoneal air between the anterior abdominal
 wall and small bowel loops with fluid collecting within this space. Findings
 are worrisome for bowel perforation and/or intraperitoneal abscesses.
 2. Free intraperitoneal air is also noted around the liver and within the
 pelvis. Ascites throughout the abdomen.
 3. No extravasation of oral contrast.

Service:  General Surgery
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 11907**] is a 70-year-old
gentleman who, in the past, had multiple abdominal surgeries.
As a consequence of his surgeries, he had developed very
large hernias along his midline incision and at the site of
his previous stoma in the left lower quadrant.  He presented
to the office comlaining of post-prandial pain at his incisional
hernias. At that time, he had elected to undergo a ventral hernia
repair which was performed laparoscopically on [**2155-2-18**].

Postoperatively, the patient did well.  He experienced some
nausea with abdominal distention which eventually resolved.
He was discharged uneventfully to the Transitional Care Unit
[**2155-2-22**], he was tolerating a regular diet and
passing flatus.  Two days after his discharge, he developed a
fever up to 101.9??????, chills, nausea but with no vomiting
with mild left upper quadrant and abdominal pain.  Pn
evaluation, he had an elevated white count of 13,000 and his
abdomen was very distended and tender on examination.  A KUB
revealed a very large collection with an air fluid level in the
mid abdomen.  A follow up CT scan confirmed free intraperitoneal
air and a large collection that appeared to be below the [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex
mesh that was placed on the previous surgery.  With the
possibility of a bowel injury and perforation, the patient
was readmitted to the [**Hospital6 256**]
and he was taken back to the Operating Room for an
exploratory laparotomy.

7.  Percocet prn.
8.  Multivitamins.
9.  Tylenol.
10. Senokot.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  No tobacco, no history of alcohol
consumption.  He lives at home alone with daily assistance
from caregivers.

ADMISSION PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:
GENERAL:  The patient was a 70-year-old male, mildly confused
in moderate distress.  He appeared mildly uncomfortable.
VITAL SIGNS:  He had a temperature of 100.6??????, heart rate of
91, blood pressure 130/72, respiratory rate 18 with an O2
saturation of 96% on room air.
HEAD, EARS, EYES, NOSE AND THROAT:  Pupils equal, round and
reactive to light and accommodation.  Extraocular movements
intact.  Sclerae are anicteric.
HEART:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Normal S1 and S2.  No
murmurs, rubs or gallops.
LUNGS:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
ABDOMEN:  Distended, tympanitic with protrusion of hernias.
Diffusely tender to palpation and light touch, but
nevertheless, the patient remained with a soft abdomen.   All
hernia sites were reducible.  There was no erythema, no
drainage.
RECTAL (as per the TCU):  Soft stool, low impaction, guaiac
positive.
EXTREMITIES:  Warm, negative edema, hyperpigmented skin.

SIGNIFICANT LABS:  White count of 13,000, hematocrit of 30.5,
platelet count of 328.  Differential showed 74% neutrophils,
5% basophils, 9% lymphocytes.  The urinalysis was negative.
Urine culture was negative.  Electrolytes:  Sodium 135,
potassium 3.9, chloride 99, CO2 26, BUN 26 with a creatinine
of 1.3 which was the patient's baseline and a glucose of 148.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2155-2-25**] at 7:30 p.m. Mr.
[**Known lastname 11907**] was taken back to the Operating Room.  He underwent an
exploratory laparotomy with oversewing of a left colonic
perforation, excision of the [**Doctor Last Name 4726**]-Tex mesh, evacuation of a
hematoma and placement of three [**Location (un) 1661**]-[**Location (un) 1662**] drains.  The
patient tolerated the procedure well and he was transferred
under stable condition to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit
for close monitoring.  Overnight, he remained hemodynamically
stable and he was weaned successfully and uneventfully off
the ventilator.  He was started on vancomycin, ceftazidime
and Flagyl for broad antibiotic coverage.

By postoperative day #2, the patient was doing well.  He was
spiking mild fevers to 100.6??????, but vital signs were stable.
His abdomen remained soft, slightly tender to palpation,
moderately distended.  His white count came down to 8.8 with
a hematocrit of 27.5 and a platelet count of 220.  His
electrolytes were within normal limits.  His pain was well
controlled on morphine and he was kept NPO with a nasogastric
tube suction.  Anticipating that the patient was going to be
nutritionally deprived, TPN was started that same day.

By postoperative day #3, the patient continued on vancomycin,
ceftazidime and Flagyl.  His vital signs were stable.  His
temperature started to trend down.  He was not complaining of
significant pain and his nasogastric tube was discontinued.  The
patient remained on the TPN.  The wound that was left open for
closure was being packed with wet-to-dry gauzes and the dressings
were changed [**Hospital1 **].  There was no evidence of infection or drainage
and there was good granulating tissue.

By postoperative day #6, Mr. [**Known lastname 111359**] foley was discontinued and
his diet was advanced to clear liquids. On postoperative day #7,
he was tolerating clears well and his diet was advanced to
regular diet as tolerated.  A physical therapy consult was
made and the patient was able to ambulate with the assistance
of the physical therapist.  Two of his JP drains were
discontinued and only one was left in place.  His po
medications were restarted.  Nutritional service was
encouraging the patient to take his po supplements tid.

On postoperative day #8, his antibiotics were discontinued.
The patient remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable.
His abdomen was soft, mildly distended and still tender to
palpation.  His wound was then packed [**Hospital1 **] and had good
granulation tissue and no infection or drainage.  The JP #3
was discontinued later that afternoon.

By postoperative day #9, Mr. [**Known lastname 11907**] was screened by the TCU
and he was found to be stable to be transferred to this
facility to continue his recovery.  His temperature at that
time was 98.9??????, blood pressure 110/60, heart rate of 60,
respiratory rate of 20, 97% O2 saturation on room air with
good urine output and his finger blood sugars below 190
currently on TPN.  The patient was advanced to a regular diet
and nutrition service was keeping a calorie count on him.
According to the last calorie count, his intake was less than
300 calories, so it was decided to keep him on TPN.  Today,
[**2155-3-6**], Mr. [**Known lastname 11907**] is being transferred to the
Transitional Care Unit to continue his recovery.

He is being transferred on these medications:
1.  Levoxyl 0.112 mg po q day.
2.  Aspirin 81 mg po q day.
3.  Wellbutrin 250 mg po q day.
4.  Colace 100 mg po bid.
5.  Norvasc 7.5 mg po q day.

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Exploratory laparotomy and repair of descending colon
perforation, status post laparoscopic LOA and ventral hernia
repair with mesh placement.

 INDICATION: Fever. Needs IV antibiotics.

 PROCEDURE: The procedure was performed by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) 4711**] [**Name (STitle) 145**] with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 934**]
 [**Name (STitle) 179**] reviewing the study. The left upper arm was prepped in a
 sterile fashion. Since no suitable superficial veins were visible, ultrasound
 was used for localization of suitable vein. The brachial vein was patent and
 compressible. After local anesthesia with 2 ml of 1% Lidocaine, the brachial
 vein was entered under ultrasonographic guidance with a 21 gauge needle. A
 0.018 guidewire was advanced under fluoroscopy into the superior vena cava.
 Based on the markers on the guidewire, it was determined that a length of 39
 cm would be suitable. The PICC line was trimmed to length and advanced over a
 4 French introducer sheath under fluoroscopic guidance into the superior vena
 cava. The sheath was removed. The catheter was flushed. A final chest x-ray
 was obtained. The film demonstrates the tip to be in the superior vena cava
 just above the atrium. The line is ready for use.

 A Statlock was applied and line was hep locked.

 Hard copy ultrasound images were obtained before and after vascular access
 documenting vessel patency.

 IMPRESSION: Successful placement of 39 cm total length double lumen PICC line
 with tip in the superior vena cava, ready for use.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  HIV, history of [**Doctor First Name 346**], abdominal pain, sepsis.

 COMPARISONS:  [**2173-6-26**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial MDCT images were obtained from the lung bases through the
 symphysis pubis without the administration of IV contrast.  Coronal and
 sagittal reconstructions were also obtained.  Contrast was not used secondary
 to the patient's renal failure.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There are new, bilateral pleural
 effusions, right greater than left with atelectasis.  Patchy airspace
 opacities are seen at the left lung base.  There has been marked enlargement
 of the cardiac [**Doctor Last Name 13032**] when compared to the previous exam.  There is a
 moderate-sized pericardial effusion.  Allowing for the lack of IV contrast,
 the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, kidneys, and adrenal glands are
 unremarkable.  There is an ill-defined low attenuation area within the spleen
 which may represent a small infarct.  There is diffuse soft tissue stranding
 consistent with anasarca.  Small amount of free fluid is seen within the
 abdomen.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is thickening of the wall of the
 colon throughout, predominantly on the right side of the colon.  There is free
 fluid within the pelvis.  A Foley catheter is seen within the bladder.

 BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  New, bilateral pleural effusions, right greater than left.  Ground-glass
 opacities at the left lung base may represent fluid overload.
 2.  Cardiomegaly with interval marked enlargement of the cardiac [**Doctor Last Name 13032**] from
 the previous CT.  Moderate pericardial effusion.
 3.  Diffuse bowel wall thickening involving the right colon to a greater
 extent than the left.  These findings may represent infectious colitis or
 possibly typhlitis.
 4.  Anasarca.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2173-12-17**].


LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Moderately dilated LV cavity. Severe
global LV hypokinesis. No LV mass/thrombus. False LV tendon (normal variant).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Mildly dilated RV cavity. Moderate global RV free wall
hypokinesis.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3).

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. Mild to moderate ([**12-20**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to moderate [[**12-20**]+] TR.
Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets. Significant
PR.

PERICARDIUM: Small to moderate pericardial effusion. No echocardiographic
signs of tamponade. Echocardiographic signs of tamponade may be absent in the
presence of elevated right sided pressures.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Left pleural effusion.

Conclusions:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with evere global hypokinesis. No left ventricular thrombus
is seen. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global
wall hypokinesis. The aortic leaflets are normal with good excursion. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally
normal. Mild to moderate ([**12-20**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. There is a small to moderate sized circumferential
pericardial effusion without evidence for tamponade physiology.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-12-17**], the pericardial
effusion is slightly larger (specifically around the right atrium). The
estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is higher, right ventricular free
wall motion may be slightly worse, and the severities of mitral and aortic
regurgitation are slightly increased..

Imaging:
[**2173-12-28**]: ECHO - Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal.
The left ventricular cavity is moderately dilated with evere
global hypokinesis. No left ventricular thrombus is seen. The
right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with moderate global
wall hypokinesis. The aortic leaflets are normal with good
excursion. No
aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. Mild to moderate ([**12-20**]+) mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery
systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic regurgitation is
seen. There is a small to moderate sized circumferential
pericardial effusion without evidence for tamponade physiology.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2173-12-17**],
the pericardial effusion is slightly larger (specifically around
the right atrium). The estimated pulmonary artery systolic
pressure is higher, right ventricular free
wall motion may be slightly worse, and the severities of mitral
and aortic regurgitation are slightly increased.
.
[**2173-12-27**]: portable abdominal film - No dilated loops of large or
small bowel are seen to indicate obstruction.  No definite free
intraperitoneal air is seen.  There are bilateral pleural
effusions with lower lobe airspace opacities.
.
[**2173-12-24**]: CT a/p - 1. New, bilateral pleural effusions, right
greater than left. Ground-glass opacities at the left lung base
may represent fluid overload. 2. Cardiomegaly with interval
marked enlargement of the cardiac [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] from the previous CT.
Moderate pericardial effusion. 3. Diffuse bowel wall thickening
involving the right colon to a greater extent than the left.
These findings may represent infectious colitis or possibly
typhlitis. 4. Anasarca.
.
[**2173-12-21**]: KUB - Non-specific bowel gas pattern. No air-fluid
levels to suggest obstruction.
.
[**12-18**]: CXR - 1. Stable cardiomegaly. 2. Improvement of the
perihilar opacities with residual opacities at the bases. This
may be secondary to resolving pulmonary edema or infectious
process.
.
[**12-17**]: ECHO - The left atrium is elongated. The left ventricular
cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed. Right ventricular chamber size
is normal. There is mild global right ventricular free wall
hypokinesis. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.
Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is moderate
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is a small
pericardial effusion. LVEF <= 20%.
.
[**12-17**]: CXR - Successful placement of 39 cm total length double
lumen PICC line with tip in the superior vena cava, ready for
use.
.
[**12-16**]: portable CXR - 1. Enlarged cardiac silhouette suggesting
cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion, which has increased
compared to the prior examination. 2. Bilateral perihilar
opacities, likely due to pulmonary edema, increased compared to
the prior examination. Superimposed infection including PCP
cannot be excluded.
.
[**12-15**]: CXR - Enlargement of the cardiac silhouette suggesting
cardiomegaly or pericardial effusion that has progressed
compared to [**2173-8-13**]. Nonspecific bibasilar opacity suggests
edema or consolidation.


Brief Hospital Course:
# PNEUMONIA: It was felt that Ms. [**Known lastname 31473**] had a pneumonia on
admission. With her history of disseminated MAC and PCP in the
past, she was treated empirically for community-acquired
pneumonia (with 10 days of levaquin), MAC (with clarithromycin
and ethambutol), and PCP (with atovaquone originally, then
clindamycin and primaquine due to nausea and vomiting associated
with the atovaquone). ID was consulted and helped guide her
management throughout her hospital course. She was hypothermic
and hypotensive on admission, which raised concerns for sepsis,
but her BP responded to fluid boluses and her temperature came
up slightly. Induced sputum x3 was sent and were negative for
PCP, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] AFB culture came back positive for AFB on [**1-3**] (AFB
smears were negative x3). Identification of the organism is
still pending, but after confirming this with ID, it was felt
that this was most likely MAC and the patient was being
adequately treated with her current azithromycin dose (1200mg PO
1x/week).
.
# HIV: Ms. [**Known lastname 31473**] was not taking her HAART medications or her
prophylaxis upon admission, so her HAART regimen was suspended
until her acute pneumonia was treated and a discussion could be
had between the patient and her PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] team was concerned that
many of her comorbidities, principally her cardiomyopathy and
her renal failure, were related to her HIV and would only
improve or remain stable with the administration of HAART. Dr.
[**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] met with Ms. [**Known lastname 31473**] on 11R and it was decided to
restart antiretrovirals, with a 5 drug salvage regimen which ID
recommended based on her resistance profile. They also helped
make recommendations for her prophylaxis, so her ethambutol and
clarithromycin were changed to azithromycin 1x/week and her
clindamycin and primaquine were changed to Bactrim. She refused
to take atovaquone because of nausea and vomiting. Because of
her history of a Bactrim allergy, she was brought to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**]
for Bactrim desensitization. Once she had begun prophylaxis and
tolerated the regimen well, she was restarted on a HAART regimen
which included zidovudine, tipranavir, ritonavir, tenofovir, and
lamivudine. She tolerated that regimen well with no change in
her symptoms (diarrhea, abd pain were unchanged) and she was
discharged on this regimen. Prior to discharge, social work
contact[**Name (NI) **] [**Name (NI) 1022**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 3912**] of the [**Name (NI) 392**]/[**Hospital3 **] AIDS Cares
Network at [**Hospital6 10353**] ([**Telephone/Fax (1) 31475**]) to set up
outpatient services for Ms. [**Known lastname 31473**].
.
# CARDIOMYOPATHY: Ms. [**Known lastname 31473**] was tachycardic and hypotensive in
the ER, with SBPs in the 60s. A BNP was checked in the ER and
was 32,538. Her SBP responded well to fluid boluses and came up
to the 90s. Her tachycardia persisted, however, EKGs showed it
was a sinus tachycardia. On the floor, she was monitored on
telemetry and she developed a HR of 170s overnight. She was
given PO and IV diltiazem which dropped her SBP and her HR to
the 70s. She was asymptomatic during this episode, but was
transferred to the [**Hospital Unit Name 153**] for closer monitoring. An ECHO showed
that her EF was < or =20% and she had severely depressed left
ventricular systolic function and mild global right ventricular
free wall hypokinesis. Her SBP came back up to the 90s in the
[**Hospital Unit Name 153**] and she was felt to be hemodynamically stable, so she was
transferred out the floor. Her volume status remained difficult
to assess as she appeared to be both total body overloaded (was
grossly edematous, with bilateral LE edema) and intravascularly
dry (no appreciable JVD, hypotensive, tachycardic, with acute on
chronic renal failure and oliguria). Renal was consulted and
after analyzing her urine sediment, felt that her picture was
most consistent with prerenal azotemia (on top of underlying HIV
nephropathy) and recommended IVF to correct her prerenal state.
She was given multiple liters of IVF with minimal improvement in
her UOP, BP and tachycardia. She become more volume overloaded
so she was given transfusions of pRBC (as her Hct was also in
the low to mid 20s), again with minimal improvement. Her Cr
remained elevated and her UOP remained poor. She was tested for
adrenal insufficiency given her persistently low BP, but she was
not adrenally insufficient by cosyntropin stimulation test. A
repeat ECHO was performed which again showed an EF of < or =
20%, dilated left and right ventricles, and moderate-severe
global hypokinesis bilaterally. There was no tamponade
physiology. Cardiology was informally consulted to see if there
would be utility to placing a line to measure CVP and then
perhaps diuresing her (likely with the addition of a pressor),
but it was felt that less invasive measures would be best in
this patient. She was restarted on digoxin (no loading dose) and
tolerated it well. Her digoxin level prior to discharge was
still subtherapeutic, but because of her renal function, it was
decided to keep her on this dose and recheck a dig level as an
outpatient. She was given metoprolol 12.5mg PO x1 to attempt to
slow down her HR, but dropped her SBP to the 70s. Her BP
responded to IVF boluses, but it was decided to not try any
further medications that could potentially drop her BP. She was
not able to be started on lasix, an ACE or spironolactone for
this reason. She was monitored on telemetry after starting the
digoxin and had one run of NSVT (13 beats).
.
# ARF: On admission, her Cr was 2.8 which appeared to be an
acute on chronic renal failure. Her urine lytes were consistent
with prerenal physiology and she was hydrated with IVF but with
only minimal improvement in her UOP. She maintained UOP of
15cc/hr for most of her hospital stay. Based on her urine
studies, it was felt that she was prerenal and needed IVF. She
was also given bicitra to attempt to correct the acidosis that
was developing from her renal failure. However, the more IVF we
gave, the more she seemed to third space and she developed
anasarca and lower extremity edema which was very troublesome to
her. Her BP was so low that we were never able to safely give
lasix to see if her UOP and edema would improve. With
administration of digoxin, her Cr began to improve and came back
down to her baseline of 2.1 by the time of discharge. She still
had significant proteinuria (spot Prot/Cr of 5510, dipstick
protein of 500) which was attributed to HIV nephropathy. Her
HAART regimen was dosed according to her discharge Cr, so her Cr
will have to be monitored closely as an outpatient and her
medications will need to be adjusted according to her CrCl.
.
# ABDOMINAL PAIN/DIARRHEA: Her abdominal pain became a more
prominent symptom once she developed anasarca. Multiple stool
studies were sent as she had frequent diarrhea, but all
cultures, including O+P and Cdiff, were negative. A CT scan of
her abdomen showed a question of typhlitis. KUB were negative
for free air or for obstruction/toxic megacolon. Ms. [**Known lastname 31476**]
abdominal pain seemed to wax and wane, but became less severe
once she began to autodiurese and her bloating and abdominal
distension resolved. Her greater concern was diarrhea. She felt
that each time she stood up, she had to have a bowel movement
and sometimes she would be incontinent because she could not
control the urge to defecate. All stool studies were negative,
including Cdiff toxin B. She was given loperamide to help
improve her diarrhea, which worked with some success. She was
given a prescription for this upon discharge, with instructions
to follow up on this symptom with her ID doctors as it could be
related to her medications (possibly the azithromycin or maybe
even her HAART regimen).
.
# ANEMIA: Ms. [**Known lastname 31473**] is anemic, with her baseline Hct in the mid
20s. She is asymptomatic from her anemia, but was given several
transfusions during her hospital stay in an attempt to increase
her BP and intravascular volume without causing third spacing.
However, her BP was minimally responsive to transfusions so they
were held unless she became symptomatic. Stools were guaiac
negative. Labs were most consistent with an anemia of chronic
disease. On discharge, her Hct was 24.5.
.
# FEN: IVF were given originally, but had to be held due to
anasarca. Her electrolytes were checked daily and were repleted
as necessary. Her K and HCO3 were often low and needed
repletion. Her Na also trended down, and she was briefly put on
a 1.5L/day fluid restriction to help bring her Na back to
normal. She was given a regular, low salt, heart healthy diet.
She was continued on Megace, though she frequently refused this
medication.
.
# PPX: Ms. [**Known lastname 31473**] was given heparin SC for DVT prophylaxis, but
she soon developed thrombocytopenia and it had to be stopped.
HIT antibodies were never sent. She was then given [**Male First Name (un) **] stockings
and pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis. She was given a bowel
regimen originally, but by the end of her stay, she was having
frequent diarrhea and no stool softeners were needed. She was
also given a PPI for GI ppx.
.
# Access: She had a peripheral line originally, then a PICC line
was placed in her L arm due to poor IV access. The PICC line
worked well for her throughout her admission, without any
evidence of infection or cellulitis.
.
# Code: FULL. A discussion was had with the patient about her
code status and the patient did not seem to understand what it
meant to code someone or what it would mean for her as the
patient. It was decided, however, that she would be CPR not
indicated in case an event were to occur.
.
# Dispo: To home with services.

Brief Hospital Course:
Ms. [**Known lastname 31473**] is a 41 yo woman with end stage AIDS, HIV
cardiomyopathy with last EF [**12-24**] <20%, and HIV nephropathy with
very low UOP and nephrotic range proteinuria who was
hospitalized in [**Month (only) 1096**] for 3 weeks with bibasilar pneumonia
for which she was given a 2 week course of levo/flagyl.  She was
discharged with stable LE edema and on an HIV salvage regimen
consisting of 5 HAART meds.  She returned to the hospital one
day after discharge complaining of possible increased LE edema,
which was found to be unchanged from prior on exam.  She seemed
to feel ""unsafe"" at home but was unable to elaborate on that.
Cultures from previous hospitalization returned at that time
with [**Doctor First Name **] in sputum and stool and she was started on treatment.
.
Five days after admission, the patient was prepared for
discharge to a [**Hospital1 1501**] with HIV specialty floor, when she complained
of new onset SOB, RR 30s-40s x hours, and eventual hypoxia.  ABG
revealed lactic acidosis with lactate of 16 and ph of 7.19.  FS
at that time was 24. This was all believed to be lactic acidosis
caused by HIV meds (zidovudine) interfering with mitochrondrial
function.  She recieved 1 amp NaHCO3, 1 amp D50 and 500 cc NS
bolus.
.
She was transferred to the ICU, where she required CVVH for
lactic acidosis and D10 for hypoglycemia.  She developed
multi-system organ failure, including liver failure, increased
oliguria, pancreatitis, and hemolysis.  She responded well to
CVVH and after family meeting CVVH was discontinued and decision
was made not to restart dialysis of any sort even if her lactic
acidosis were to recur.  She was treated with aztreonam and
vanco by levels for bilateral pneumonia.  The patient expressed
an interest in going to hospice.  A palliative care consult was
ordered and pt was transferred to floor.
.
The patient's 13 year old daughter is not aware of her mother's
HIV status and the patient has not been forthcoming about her
current prognosis.  A family meeting with the patient, Drs.
[**Last Name (STitle) 31478**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 31479**] social worker [**Name (NI) 30513**], the patient's
daughter [**Name (NI) 31480**], her daughter's cousin, and Ms. [**Known lastname 31476**]
sister-in-law. At this meeting the family was updated on the
patient's generally poor prognosis. The pt decided that she
would like to go to hospice, and understood the goals of
hospice. The pt was seen by Palliative care and she was placed
in a hospice of her choice. The pt stated she would like to
complete the course of PO antibiotics which were started in the
MICU. Her central line was pulled, uneventfully, on the day of
discharge. The patient was discharged on cefpodoxime and
azithromycin for 4 days to complete her course of antibiotics
for pneumonia. The pt will be continued on her digoxin for heart
failure, ipratropium nebulizer for shortness of breath, Bactrim
for PCP prophylaxis, [**Name9 (PRE) 31481**] for hyperphosphatemia secondary to
renal failure and lasix for shortness of breath and painful
lower extremity edema.
.
The pt reported that she will inform her family of the tranfer
to the hospice facility. Her brother was present for this
conversation.

After discussion with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1629**], it was decided that the
patient will not be discharged on MAC prophylaxis (Azithromycin)
and Digoxin. This was to prevent digoxin toxicity in light of
declining renal function (pt will not have any lab testing done
at hospice). Also, the pt did not have any evidence of MAC on
discharge and will continue her 4 day course of antibiotics for
pneumonia.

 INDICATION:  Scitzo-affective disorder,  status-post unknown type of
 neurosurgery, recently extubated with altered mental status.  Evaluate for
 hemorrhage or other acute intracranial processes.

 TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast CT of the head was obtained without comparisons.

 FINDINGS:  Examination detail is limited by motion artifact despite multiple
 rescans.

 There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage, mass effect, or shift of
 normally midline structures.  The frontal horns of the lateral ventricles have
 an unusual configuration, although extra-axial spaces are otherwise within
 normal limits.  The [**Doctor Last Name 37**]/white matter differentiation is preserved.  There is
 no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures.  Examination of the
 osseous and soft tissue structures demonstrates small defects along the outer
 table of the frontal cortex bilaterally, associated with indentation to the
 skin at these levels.  These presumably relate to the prior neurosurgery
 mentioned in the indication.  In addition, there is mild mucosal thickening
 within the maxillary sinuses and ethmoid sinuses.

 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.  Post-
 procedural changes of the frontal bones and overlying soft tissues, as well as
 presumable post-procedure changes of the frontal lobe resulting in unusual
 configuration of the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles.

Chief Complaint:
Clozaril Overdose

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None


History of Present Illness:
Pt is 36F h/o ""schizophrenia"" admitted for clozapine overdose.
Per report of her psychiatrist (per ED note) pt's mother was
treating her daughter at home for schizophrenia. She kept her
locked in the house during the days while she was at work
believing that the pt may be denied a Green Card upon receiving
the diagnosis of schizophrenia. Starting in [**Name (NI) 1096**], pt began
to express her desire to end her life, so mother sought medical
attention. On day of admission pt was found at home on the
floor, unconscious in a pool of vomit, surrounded by 5 empty
bottles of clozapine (100 25mg tabs per bottle). EMS was called,
pt was thrashing, incoherent and agitated. Taken to [**Hospital1 18**] ED
where she was intubated for airway protection.

In ED received Ativan 2 mg IV, activated charcoal,
succ/etomidate and 3L NS. Propofol gtt was ineffective in
sedating her so pt was paralyzed with vecuronium, thinking that
her lactate may improve if twitching stopped. Her lactate did
not improve and vecuronium d/c'd.

Date of Birth:   [**2113-5-22**]     Sex:  F

Service:  CCU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:   Chief complaint is status post acute
myocardial infarction complicated by ventricular fibrillation
at rest.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   Ms. [**Known lastname 18647**] is a 57-year-old
woman with no prior history of coronary artery disease;
however, with a remote 15-pack-per year history of tobacco
use and a family history positive for coronary artery disease
who was in her usual state of health until two days prior to
admission.

At that time, the patient noticed intermittent epigastric
discomfort and multiple episodes of chest pressure throughout
the day.  Each episode lasted between 7 minutes and 15
minutes and occurred both with exertion and at rest.

On the morning of admission, the patient had one episode of
chest pressure and left-sided neck pain which lasted
approximately 15 minutes.  This pain resolved spontaneously.
The patient was then well until 7 p.m. on the day of
admission; at which point she noticed increasing chest
pressure which prompted her to go to the Emergency Department
at an outside hospital.

En route to the Emergency Department, she developed worsening
substernal chest pain without any radiation.  However, this
was associated with diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting, and the
feeling of doom.

In the Emergency Department, she developed further chest
pain.  An electrocardiogram showed ST elevations in V2
through V6, and also in leads I and aVL, with ST depressions
in leads II, III, and aVF.  The patient was given aspirin and
Retavase 10 mg intravenously times one; at which point, she
had ventricular fibrillation at rest.  The patient was
shocked once at 200 joules and then 300 joules; after which
she returned to a normal sinus rhythm.  The patient became
chest pain free after Retavase.  The ST segment elevations
returned to baseline.  The patient was then started on
heparin, Integrilin, and amiodarone and was transferred to
[**Hospital1 69**] Coronary Care Unit for
cardiac catheterization.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:   Status post total abdominal
hysterectomy for endometrial cancer 30 years ago.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Premarin 0.625 mg p.o. q.d. (for
one and a half years) and Citracal.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She is a nursery teacher.  She lives with
her husband, her daughter, and her daughter's husband and
child.  She has four children.  She has a remote history of
tobacco use; 15-pack-per year history.  She quit in [**2144**].
She denies any cocaine, heroin, or intravenous drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Her mother had a myocardial infarction at
the age of 55 to 60.  Her brother had a myocardial infarction
at the age of 59.  They are both status post coronary artery
bypass graft.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Examination on arrival
revealed temperature was 97.6, heart rate was 99, in a normal
sinus rhythm, blood pressure was 102/64, respiratory rate was
26, oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters.  General
appearance revealed a middle-aged woman in no acute distress;
moderately anxious, chest pain free.  Head, eyes, ears, nose,
and throat examination revealed pupils were equal, round, and
reactive to light.  The oropharynx with bleeding.  The neck
revealed jugular venous pressure approximately 10 cm of
water.  No bruits.  The chest was clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Heart revealed a regular rate and rhythm.  No
gallops and no murmurs.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, and
nondistended with active bowel sounds.  Extremities were warm
and obese.  Dorsalis pedis pulses were palpable bilaterally.
Neurologically, alert and oriented times three.  Cranial
nerves II through XII were intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:   Laboratories
revealed white blood cell count was 12.7, hematocrit was 41,
and platelets were 417.  Chemistry-7 revealed sodium was 141,
potassium was 3.5, chloride was 100, bicarbonate was 23,
blood urea nitrogen was 20, creatinine was 0.9, and blood
glucose was 113.  AST was 16, ALT was 12, albumin was 3.4.
Creatine kinase was 82.  Troponin was 0.15 at the outside
hospital (where less than 0.2 is considered normal).  PT was
10.6, INR was 0.8, PTT was 24.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  First electrocardiogram revealed a normal
sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 63, ST elevations in V2
through V6 in leads I and aVL.  ST depressions in leads II,
III, and aVF.

Second electrocardiogram, status post Retavase revealed a
normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate of 64 with premature
ventricular contractions.  Still with ST depressions in leads
III and aVF with resolution of ST elevations in leads V2
through V6, I, and aVL.

Third electrocardiogram, status post ventricular fibrillation
arrest and cardioversion, revealed a normal sinus rhythm with
a heart rate of 87.  Complete resolution of ST depressions in
aVF and lead III and complete resolution of all ST elevations
in leads V2 through V6, I, and aVL.

Electrocardiogram at [**Hospital1 69**]
upon arrival revealed a normal sinus rhythm with a heart rate
of 82, good R wave progression.  No Q waves.  No ST
elevations.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   Ms. [**Known lastname 18647**] is a 57-year-old woman who
presented status post anterolateral myocardial infarction;
successfully treated with thrombolytics.

Ms. [**Known lastname 18647**] was continued on a heparin drip and Integrilin drip
from admission until Monday, [**2170-12-24**] when she went
to cardiac catheterization.  During this time she was
consistently chest pain free.

The cardiac catheterization showed single vessel disease with
90% stenosis at the origin of the left anterior descending
artery.  The proximal left anterior descending artery lesion
was stented with good flow.  An echocardiogram showed severe
focal hypokinesis of the anterolateral septum with an
ejection fraction of 51%.

After cardiac catheterization, she received Integrilin
infusion for another 18 hours.  She was then loaded on
Plavix, and she was continued on Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.  Her
peak creatine kinase was 270.  A fasting cholesterol panel
was obtained which showed  total cholesterol of 239,
low-density lipoprotein of 140, and high-density lipoprotein
of 61.  Therefore, she was started on atorvastatin 10 mg p.o.
q.d.  Premarin was stopped.

Her heart rate remained in a normal sinus rhythm with a rate
ranging between 80 to 105.  She was started on Lopressor
which was titrated up as tolerated; up to 75 mg p.o. b.i.d.
which was then converted to Toprol-XL at discharge for
patient convenience.  However, her heart rate continued to be
slightly elevated; ranging between the 80s and 90s.
Therefore, a thyroid-stimulating hormone was obtained to rule
out hypothyroidism.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Discharge status was to home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:  Aborted anterolateral myocardial
infarction.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d. (for one month).
2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Lipitor 10 mg p.o. q.d.
4.  Toprol-XL 100 mg p.o. q.d.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:
1.  The patient was to follow up with cardiac rehabilitation
in [**Location (un) **].
2.  The patient was also to follow up with her primary care
physician within the next two weeks.
3.  To follow up Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] if her insurance permits this
within the next one month.

[**Last Name (NamePattern4) 4125**]ospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2147-4-5**] for surgical
management of her aortic valve disease. She was taken to the
operating room where she underwent an aortic valve replacement
utilizing a 21mm pericardial valve. Postoperatively she was
taken to the cardiac surgical intensive care unit. On
postoperative day one, she awoke neurologically intact and was
extubated. She was then transferred to the cardiac surgical step
down unit for further recovery. Mrs. [**Known lastname **] was gently diuresed
towards her preoperative weight. The physical therapy service
was consulted for assistance with her postoperative strength and
mobility. Her pacing wires and drains were removed per protocol
without incident. On postoperative day five, Mrs. [**Known lastname **] had a
fever spike. She was pan cultured and empirically started on
ciprofloxacin.Her urine culture was positive for E.Coli and
ciprofloxacin was continued. She complained of numbness of her
right lateral thigh which improved slowly. It was presumed that
this was related to a right lateral femoral cutaneous nerve
neuropathy likely from positioning. Mrs [**Known lastname **] continued to make
steady progress and was discharged home on postoperative day
six. She will follow-up with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **], her cardiologist
and her primary care physician as an outpatient.

Service:  CCU/MEDICINE
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname 13143**] is a
45-year-old gentleman with a past medical history of
hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia and gout who
was in his usual state of health until 2:00 a.m. on the day
of admission.  At that time, the patient was awakened by
associated with diaphoresis.  The pain resolved spontaneously
after ten minutes but then recurred 20 minutes later, [**7-31**] in
intensity and again associated with diaphoresis.  It was also
associated this time with dizziness and the pain was
radiating into his sternal area.  There was no associated
shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, or palpitations.

the Emergency Department by his wife who is a nurse
practitioner. He was taken via ambulance.  His pain at that
time was [**1-1**] after two sublingual nitroglycerin.  At the
outside hospital, the patient was found to have ST
depressions in leads II, III, and aVF and he was hypertensive
with a blood pressure of 200/110.  He was given sublingual
nitroglycerin, heparin drip, and beta blocked and
subsequently experienced a witnessed V-fib arrest and
required shocking with 200 joules.

He returned to sinus bradycardia and then a normal sinus
rhythm.  He was started on a lidocaine drip and then
transferred to the [**Hospital1 18**] Cath lab for persistent
discomfort/chest pain.

At cardiac catheterization, the patient had the following
hemodynamics.  Cardiac output was 5.24 with a cardiac index
of 2.48.  The pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was elevated
at 26 and his right atrial pressure was 13.  On angiography
he had a left dominant system with luminal irregularities in
the LAD, 30% stenosis of the left circumflex, and the
patient's ramus was completely occluded.  The ramus was
Angio-Jetted and then stented with restoration of TIMI-III
flow.

The patient was then transferred to the CCU.  On review of
systems in the CCU, the patient denied chest pain, shortness
of breath.  On review of systems, he states that he was
noticing minimal bilateral lower extremity edema prior to
admission but denied dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, PND, or
palpitations.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION IN THE CCU:  Vitals:  Temperature 98,
blood pressure 127/56, pulse 82, saturation 96% on 2 liters
nasal cannula.  The patient had a Swan-Ganz catheter in
place.  In general, the patient was lying in bed in no
apparent distress.  He was speaking in full sentences.
HEENT:  The pupils were equal, reactive, and round to light
and accommodation.  The oropharynx was clear and dry.  He was
anicteric.  The neck was supple.  No bruits.  JVP could not
be adequately assessed.  His lungs were clear to auscultation
anteriorly and laterally.  His abdominal examination revealed
a soft abdomen, nontender, nondistended, no masses.  Arterial
and venous sheaths were in place in the right groin without
hematoma or ooze.  His pulses were full times four, warm and
well perfuse.  The neurological examination was grossly
intact.

LABORATORY DATA AND OTHER STUDIES:  The patient's EKG in the
CCU was normal sinus at 93, axis within normal limits,
intervals within normal limits.  His EKG showed right atrial
enlargement and T wave flattening in leads F and aVL.

He had a hematocrit of 39.7, white count 15.7, hemoglobin
13.3, platelet count 271,000.  Chemistries revealed a sodium
of 138, potassium 4.4, chloride 101, bicarbonate 25, BUN 19,
creatinine 1.1, glucose 124.  His magnesium was 1.5.  His
first CK was 1506 with an MB of 232.  Prior CKs at the
outside hospital included a CK of 169 with an MB of 2.2 and a
troponin of 0.15.

Chest x-ray at the outside hospital showed clear lung fields
and no cardiomegaly.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Gout.
2.  Hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia; at last
check total cholesterol 278 with a triglyceride level of
1,000.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Bilateral knee menisci repair.

MEDICATIONS AT HOME:
1.  Lipitor 20 q.d.
2.  Tums p.r.n.
3.  Indocin p.r.n. for gout.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works in IT for [**Company **].
He is married and lives with his wife and son.  [**Name (NI) **] is a
nonsmoker.  He does not use intravenous drugs.  He drinks
6-12 beers per week.

FAMILY HISTORY:
1.  Mother with MI at age 42.
2.  Father with CVA at age 68.  The patient's father also
suffered from gout.

HOSPITAL COURSE:
1.  CARDIAC:  From a cardiac standpoint, the patient is
status post his first MI which was in the ramus
distribution.  He also had symptoms of CHF with elevated
wedge pressures and left-sided pressures.  The patient was
placed on metoprolol, Captopril, and was given Lasix 20 mg IV
times one to mobilize the fluid from his elevated pulmonary
capillary wedge pressure.

The patient was also placed on aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
Status post stenting of the ramus, he was placed on Plavix 75
q.d. which to be continued for nine months status post
stenting.  The patient's CK peaked at 1,711 on the evening of
[**2164-11-18**] and then on [**2164-11-19**] his CK was 1380, on [**2164-11-20**],
the day of discharge, his CK had fallen to 409.

The patient's cholesterol panel came back with a total
cholesterol of 209, HDL 42, calculated LDL of 90 and a
triglyceride level of 386 with a cholesterol to HDL ratio of
5.  Realizing that these levels are not accurate during an
acute event, the patient was continued on his outpatient
regimen of Lipitor 20 q.d. and was told to follow-up with his
outpatient cardiologist for remeasurement of the cholesterol
panel and appropriate adjustment of his Lipitor dosage.

The patient's LFTs were also checked on [**2164-11-20**] as he was
being continued on a statin.  His ALT was slightly elevated
at 73.  His AST was essentially within normal limits at 48,
alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin were normal at 94
and 0.7 respectively.  The patient was old to follow-up with his
primary cardiologist regarding appropriate dosage of the statin.

RHYTHM:  From a rhythm standpoint, the patient was status
post V-fib arrest in the setting of an MI.  He was placed on
telemetry and monitored closely for recurrent episodes of
V-tach.  He had one episode on [**2164-11-19**] of a 14-beat run of
V-tach that was asymptomatic.  His electrolytes were within
normal limits including his magnesium which had been repleted
and was 2.2 at the time of the arrhythmia.  The patient was
kept on telemetry through [**2164-11-20**] and had no recurrent
episodes of V-tach or nonsustained V-tach or PVCs for that
matter.

The patient had an echocardiogram to help risk stratify  him.
His echocardiogram showed a normal EF of 55%.  The left
atrium had a normal size.  The left ventricle had normal wall
thickness.  Cavity size and systolic function was within
normal limits with no noted wall motion abnormalities.  His
right atrium was normal size as well as his right ventricle.
His valves were all stated to be structurally normal.  He had
mild mitral annular calcification with trivial MR.

It was felt that the patient would not require an EP study
with this normal EF and with no recurrence of the ventricular
arrhythmia.  The patient had originally been on a lidocaine
drip and this was discontinued 24 hours after his event.

PUMP FUNCTION:  As stated, above this was completely normal
on his echocardiogram with an EF of 55%.

CARDIAC FOLLOW-UP:  The patient was to see his primary care
physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **] few days after discharge, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], at
[**Hospital3 1196**].  His primary care physician will
refer him to a cardiologist at [**Hospital1 **].

Of note, the patient's wife is a nurse practitioner [**First Name (Titles) **]
[**Last Name (Titles) **] and is very involved in the patient's care.
She has already arranged for the patient to follow-up in
cardiac rehabilitation at [**Hospital1 **].  The patient was
advised to take a week off from work and attend cardiac
rehabilitation.

He was seen by physical therapy during his stay and was able
to walk two flight of stairs without chest pain or shortness
of breath.

2.  RHEUMATOLOGY:  The patient has a history of gout and did
have a gouty flare of the arch of his right foot on the
evening of [**2164-11-19**].  He was initially given Percocet for
pain management as it was felt that Indocin should be avoided
in the setting of acute MI.  However, with the patient's
normal EF and absence of ventricular scarring, his risks for
wall rupture was extremely low.  Therefore, the patient was
told that he could have a trial of colchicine and if this did
not work he could resume his outpatient medication of
Indocin.

He was started on colchicine on the day of discharge, given a
trial dose of 0.5 mg p.o. and would be discharged on the
following medications.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Lisinopril 5 mg q.d.
2.  Atenolol 25 mg q.d.
3.  Atorvostatin 20 mg q.h.s.
4.  Aspirin 325 mg q.d.
5.  Plavix 75 mg q.d.
6.  Colchicine 0.5 to 1 mg q.i.d. for a maximum of 8 mg q.d.,
titrate to pain relief or development of side effects,
nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.  These instructions were gone
over thoroughly with the patient.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was discharged to home with his
wife.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lethargy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 48-year-old HIV
positive African-American male with a history of
polysubstance abuse, hepatitis C, cirrhosis and hypertension
who was admitted to [**Hospital 10073**] Hospital on [**2177-2-10**], for
detox following a recent binge using crack cocaine (about one
gram per day), alcohol (one pint of wine per day) and Xanax
and Klonopin while on Methadone maintenance.  On [**2177-2-12**], he was noted to have fluctuating mental status
(somnolence, disorientation) and after being found down
beside his bed confused, with a bloody nose and a blood
pressure of 170/130, he was presumed to have had a seizure.
He was given 1 mg of Ativan and was brought to the [**Hospital1 1444**] Emergency Department.
Following a negative head CT, no further seizures and stable
vital signs, the patient was discharged back to Bornwood on
an Ativan taper.  On [**2177-2-13**], the patient was reported
to be lethargic and ataxic, with a blood pressure of 150/100.
EMT brought the patient back to [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department, where his vital signs included a
blood pressure of 190/90, pulse of 88 and a respiratory rate
of 4, satting 94% on room air.  The patient was barely
responsive to sternal rub, with constricted pupils and was
started on Narcan, receiving a dose of 0.06 mg/hour with good
effect.  He was admitted to the MICU in the early a.m. on
[**2177-2-14**].  It was difficult to obtain additional history
from the patient at this time.  Subsequently it was learned
that the patient received some OxyContin 40 mg from a friend
while at detox, and remembers taking it prior to admission to
the hospital, although he is unclear as to what day he took
it.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  HIV positive since [**2162-3-12**].  A CD4 count of 78 with an
undetectable viral load was noted in [**2176-9-10**] as per the
patient's primary care physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8271**].  The
patient has a history of thrush as per previous dictation
summaries.  There is a question of a history of PCP in the
past.  The patient was on HAART, but this was discontinued in
the fall of last year because of decompensating liver disease
in the setting of hepatitis C.
2.  Multisubstance abuse including intravenous drug abuse.
The patient has a long-standing history of multisubstance
abuse going back 25 years that includes intravenous heroin
and cocaine abuse, benzodiazepine use including Xanax and
Klonopin, and ethanol.  The patient has been in and out of
rehabilitation facilities in the past, stays on long term
Methadone maintenance.  While the patient does admit to
recent use of cocaine, ethanol, and benzodiazepines, he
denies use of heroin for several months, stating that he does
not crave heroin while he is on Methadone.
3.  Hepatitis C positive.  The patient has active hepatitis C
disease with a high viral load and is not a candidate for
therapy at this time considering his current treatment for
depression.  His albumin has been as low as 2.5 in the past
but has improved since holding HAART therapy.  He has no
history of ascites or gastrointestinal bleed.  The patient
falls between Child Class B and C cirrhosis.
4.  Pan cytopenia likely secondary to HIV and ethanol abuse.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Depression.
7.  History of tuberculosis exposure.
8.  History of bacterial endocarditis, Staph positive in the
past ([**2161**] and [**2168**] hospitalizations).
9.  History of sternoclavicular septic arthritis in [**2167**].
10. Status post motor vehicle accident with head trauma.
11. Bilateral leg pain and numbness secondary to peripheral
neuropathy.
12. Status post appendectomy.
13. Status post inguinal hernia repair.
14. Question of a distant history of seizure.

MEDICATIONS PRIOR TO ADMISSION:
1.  Methadone 55 mg q. day.
2.  Prozac 20 mg q. day.
3.  Ativan 1 mg t.i.d. taper.
4.  Thiamine.
5.  Folate.
6.  Clonidine 0.2 t.i.d. p.r.n.
7.  Motrin 400 mg q. 4h. p.r.n.
8.  Mylanta 30 cc q. 4h. p.r.n.
9.  Ativan 1 mg p.o. q. 4h. p.r.n.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives with his wife in
[**Location (un) 686**] and has five children and several grandchildren.
He is retired since [**2172**] after working for American Airlines
as a ramp worker.  He now lives on SSI with Mass Health and
Veterans benefits that cover his medications.  As previously
mentioned, he has an extensive history of intravenous drug
abuse that includes intravenous heroin and cocaine abuse that
extends back for decades.  His recent binge was attributed to
increased depression of recent time because of his inability
to stay clean, his cirrhosis and chronic illnesses, a recent
fight with his wife, multiple deaths in the family, and an
upcoming court date next week for a DUI that he was arrested
for in [**Month (only) 404**] of this year.  The patient has a one pack per
day smoking history and, while he denies extensive abuse of
alcohol, he does admit to recently drinking one pint or one
bottle of wine per day.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has allergy to Bactrim that causes
him to have a rash.  The patient has an allergy to nafcillin
which has also given him exfoliative dermatitis of the palms
and soles in the past.

FAMILY HISTORY:  The patient's mother is healthy at age 83.
The patient's father is 82 years old, suffering from diabetes
mellitus.  The patient has two sisters who have died of
cancer, one at the age of 58 and one who passed away in her
20's.  There is no family history of substance abuse.  There
is a question of a history of depression in the patient's
mother.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  At admission the patient denied
complaints of headache, chest pain, shortness of breath,
nausea, vomiting, fevers or chills.  He had no complaints of
diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain at the time.  No
dysuria or increased urinary frequency.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION AT PRESENTATION:  On physical
examination at presentation to the Intensive Care Unit floor
the patient had the following vital signs:  He was afebrile
with a heart rate of 75, blood pressure of 139/101, a
respiratory rate of 18 and he was saturating 100% on room
air.  General appearance:  The patient was very somnolent,
but responsive to questions and without tremulousness.  On
examination of the head, eyes, ears, nose and throat, the
patient was normocephalic, atraumatic.  Mucus membranes were
dry.  Pupils were 4 mm and reactive to light bilaterally.
The patient's neck was supple without lymphadenopathy.  On
pulmonary examination the lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally without wheezes or crackles.  On cardiovascular
examination, there was a normal rate and rhythm with normal
S1, S2.  A systolic murmur was appreciated at the apex.  On
abdominal examination normal bowel sounds were present.  The
abdomen was soft, non-tender and non-distended.  The
extremities were without edema or cyanosis.  On neurological
examination, the patient was alert and oriented times three.
Cranial nerves II through XII were intact.  No focal motor
deficits were appreciated.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  The patient had
the following laboratories on admission:  A complete blood
count revealed a white blood cell count of 1.9 with an ANC of
700, hematocrit of 32.5 and a platelet count of 53,000.
Chem-7 (hemolyzed) showed a sodium of 137, potassium of 4.8,
chloride of 103, bicarbonate of 31, BUN of 13, creatinine of
0.8 and a glucose of 118.  A serum tox screen for aspirin,
ethanol, acetaminophen, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, TCA
was negative.

RADIOLOGY/STUDIES AT ADMISSION:
1.  Electrocardiogram:  Sinus rhythm, with left ventricular
hypertrophy and left atrial abnormality.  Nonspecific ST
changes were observed.  Q2 prolongation that is new on this
EKG was observed compared with previous [**2170-12-16**] EKG.
2.  Chest x-ray:  Mild to moderate cardiac enlargement with
prominent left ventricle contour.  Wide thoracic aorta.  No
evidence of pulmonary congestion or infiltrates.
3.  Head CT:  Head CT from [**2177-2-12**] Emergency Department visit
showed mild focal dilatation, with a normal ventricular
system.  No midline shift, mass, mass effect, hemorrhage was
observed.  Chronic paranasal sinus disease was noted.

IMPRESSION AT ADMISSION:  This is a 45-year-old
African-American male with a history of polysubstance abuse,
HIV and hepatitis C who came to the Emergency Department with
stuporous mental status changes from detox facility.  This
was felt to be most likely from an opiate overdose, as the
patient appeared to respond to Narcan while in the Emergency
Department.  Infection as a possible etiology for mental
status changes could not be completely ruled out in this HIV
positive patient with his last CD4 count of 78.  However, the
patient does recall taking an extra 40 mg of OxyContin prior
to admission on top of his maintenance Methadone dose of 55
mg per day and benzodiazepine taper that he had been started
on after his [**2177-2-12**] Emergency Department visit, making
overdose more likely.

HOSPITAL COURSE IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT:
[**Unit Number **].  Neurological:  Patient's mental status changes which
included increased lethargy to stuporousness, pinpoint pupils
and decreased respiratory rate in the setting of Methadone,
benzodiazepine and opiate use make opiate overdose the most
likely cause of this patient's presentation.  The patient
showed good response to naloxone throughout his stay in the
Intensive Care Unit which was continued as a drip until [**2177-2-15**], with dramatic improvement in the patient's state of
alertness.  Other causes for his change in mental status
included withdrawal from benzodiazepines and alcohol,
electrolyte abnormalities, infection, intracranial processes,
as well as renal hepatic disease.  For that reason,
electrolytes were followed, calcium, magnesium, phosphate
levels were sent.  An LP was also performed.  The patient was
pan cultured, including cultures for blood, urine and
cerebrospinal fluid.  Because of the patient's history of
alcohol and benzodiazepine use with the last alcohol use
likely on [**2177-2-10**], there was a possibility of
withdrawal in this patient, so a CIWA protocol with diazepam
q. 4h. for a score greater than 10.  Clonidine p.r.n. was
also continued for the possibility of developing opiate
withdrawal.  In this patient with depression, his Prozac was
held while he was in the Intensive Care Unit.  A Neurology
consult felt that the seizure on [**2177-2-12**], was most
likely secondary to a combination of withdrawal from both
alcohol and benzodiazepines.  As recent cocaine was evident
in the urine tox screen, there was some concern of a cerebral
infarct, but a negative CT and nonfocal neuro examination
made this less likely.  Liver function tests and ammonia were
also sent in this patient with a history of hepatitis C.

Patient's laboratory values while in the Intensive Care Unit
on [**2177-2-14**], included a calcium of 8.0, magnesium of 1.4
and a phosphate of 3.1.  The patient's PT was 13.7, INR was
1.2 and PTT was 37.7.  The patient had an elevated AST of
101, an ALT of 52, an alkaline phosphatase of 129, and a
total bilirubin of 0.8.  His albumin was 2.7 and was repeated
that same day and found to be 3.1.  Amylase was 98 and lipase
was 63.  The patient had an ammonia elevated to 95 with no
history of previous baseline ammonia recorded in the past.  A
urine tox screen was positive for cocaine and Methadone and
negative for benzodiazepines.  An LP was performed on [**2177-2-14**], which showed 0 white blood cells, 6 red blood cells,
a protein of 37, and a glucose of 57.  The Gram stain was
negative for PMNs, no microorganisms were seen.  Cryptococcal
antigen was not detected, and fluid, acid fast, viral, and
fungal cultures were sent.

2.  Infectious Disease:  This patient is HIV positive and
hepatitis C positive, and it is possible that infection could
also be an underlying cause of his mental status changes.  As
mentioned he was pan cultured, including blood, urine, CSF
and stool cultures.  Tests for CD4 count and viral load were
sent.  The patient reported that he has not been on
retrovirals since the fall of last year.  Liver function
tests were ordered to follow up the status of his cirrhosis,
and were elevated as previously mentioned in this dictation.
Throughout the patient's duration in the Intensive Care Unit,
he did not complain of fevers, shortness of breath or
productive cough, dysuria, or other complaints suggestive of
infectious process.

3.  Pulmonary:  The patient's respiratory rate improved on
Narcan drip while in the Intensive Care Unit and there was no
need to intubate.

4.  Cardiac:  The patient has a history of hypertension and
has used beta blockers in the past.  He has not been on his
hypertensive medication during the past several days while at
detox.  His pressures remained elevated while in the
Intensive Care Unit.  In the evening of [**2177-2-14**], he was
hypertensive to 206 and was given a dose of hydralazine for
control of his pressure.  Subsequently, lisinopril 5 mg q.
day and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q. day were begun to better
control his pressure.  The patient's EKG showed an increased
QT prolongation from prior EKG, in the setting of a potassium
of 3.4 upon repeat Chem-7 on [**2177-2-14**].  It was unclear
that any of the other medicines that the patient were taking
should be associated with causing this QT prolongation.  The
patient's potassium was repleted.

5.  Hematology.  The patient's pan cytopenia was noted on
CBC.  This was stable throughout his stay in the Intensive
Care Unit.

6.  Renal/Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition.  The patient
was given maintenance fluids of one-half normal saline 100 cc
per hour.  These were maintained until the patient's mental
status improved.  He began tolerating p.o.'s on [**2177-2-15**].  Because of the patient's elevated ammonia, he was
placed on a low protein diet once he was able to tolerate
p.o.'s.  Electrolytes were followed daily and were repleted
as necessary, with potassium and magnesium requiring
repletion.  The patient was placed on thiamine, folate and a
multivitamin considering the patient's history of alcohol
abuse.

7.  Gastrointestinal:  The patient has a history of cirrhosis
in the setting of HAART use that was discontinued in [**2176-9-10**] with a history of ethanol abuse.  He has had elevated
transaminases, PT and albumin of 3.1 and elevated ammonia.
Lactulose was started at 30 cc t.i.d., titrated to less than
two stools per day to treat the elevated ammonia.  Hepatitis
C serologies were not sent at this time and will likely be
followed as an outpatient.

8.  Prophylaxis.  The patient was placed on subcu heparin and
Pepcid IV q. day.

SUMMARY OF INTENSIVE CARE UNIT STAY:  The patient's mental
status continued to improve on Narcan drip which was weaned
over 12 hours to a respiratory rate greater than 11.
Cultures remained negative during the ICU stay.  The patient
was able to tolerate p.o.'s prior to transfer.  Vital signs
were stable, although his blood pressures remained elevated
prior to transfer.  The patient was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 8559**] [**Company 191**] Service on [**2177-2-15**].

HOSPITAL COURSE ON THE FLOOR ([**2177-2-15**] to [**2177-2-17**]):
1.  Neurological:  On arrival to the floor, the patient was
breathing comfortably in no acute distress and was alert and
oriented with some depressed mood.  He did complain of some
symptoms of nausea, chills, diaphoresis, aches and pains,
diarrhea, that he thought were consistent with his typical
withdrawal symptoms.  He was continued on the CIWA protocol
with p.r.n. diazepam, and clonidine was continued for his
complaints of opiate withdrawal.  His Methadone was begun on
the floor at a dose of 55 mg q. day.  Lactulose was also
considered in light of his elevated ammonia, although
encephalopathy appeared to be unlikely in this patient with
no asterixis or additional changes in mental status.  We
continued to follow daily labs which showed a white blood
cell count of 1.7, hematocrit of 32.6 and a platelet count of
47,000, with an ANC of 740.  Electrolytes showed a sodium of
137, potassium 3.3, chloride 107, bicarbonate 22, BUN 8,
creatinine 0.5 and glucose 98.  Calcium was 7.5, magnesium
1.8 and phosphate was 3.0.  While the PT and INR were now
normal, PTT remained slightly elevated at 39.  The patient
was offered a nicotine patch for his nicotine addiction which
he declined.  The patient's mental status continued to be
stable during his stay on the floor, with no signs of overt
anxiety, hallucinations, instability, but the patient was
somewhat depressed and nervous, which he admitted was
primarily due to his worry about personal stressors.  His
symptoms of opiate withdrawal were also negligible during his
second and third days on the floor.  Prozac was restarted on
his last day of admission for depression.  It appeared that
the patient had very few symptoms of ethanol withdrawal,
however, his blood pressure did remain elevated throughout
his stay but without tachycardia.  The patient's symptoms of
opiate withdrawal seemed to be well controlled on his
Methadone maintenance dose although the patient did receive
one to two doses of benzodiazepine per day, and requested
clonidine on his final day of admission p.r.n.  However, the
patient does admit that he feels better than he has in years
physically but admits that it is psychological problems and
depression that make him feel most concerned at this time.
We had several discussions with the patient regarding the
seriousness of this hospital admission and the risk of poor
outcome if he continues such risky behaviors, as this
overdose might have been life threatening.  The patient is
actually quite thoughtful and clearly depressed with his
current health situation, living environment (""my
neighborhood is full of drugs""), and life stressors (several
deaths in the recent past in his family).

2.  Infectious Disease.  The patient's CD4 count was found to
be 48 during this admission and his viral load is still
pending.  The patient remained afebrile throughout his
admission, without complaints of fever, productive cough,
dysuria, abdominal pain, or other clinical signs concerning
for infection.  Blood, stool and cerebrospinal fluid cultures
have been negative to date.  Prophylaxis was begun for PCP
with dapsone and fluconazole was also started in this patient
with a history of thrush.  However, fluconazole was
discontinued prior to __________ as prophylaxis is not
indicated routinely in HIV positive patients.  As the
patient's CD4 count is below 50, toxoplasmosis titers were
also sent, and should be followed up for possible
toxoplasmosis prophylaxis as well as [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis as an
outpatient.

3.  Cardiovascular.  The patient's EKG was repeated on [**2177-2-16**], and was found to be unchanged from admission EKG,
with suddenly prolonged QT interval.  Potassium was also 3.2
on [**2177-2-16**], and was repleted.  The patient's blood
pressure continued to be elevated throughout his stay on the
floor, in the 150's to 180's over 90's to 100's.  The dose of
lisinopril was increased to 10 q. day, and it was decided
prior to discharge to change the patient's blood pressure
regimen to 10 mg lisinopril b.i.d., to discontinue the
hydrochlorothiazide, and to begin Norvasc 5 mg p.o. q. day.

4.  Pulmonary.  The patient was breathing comfortably with
normal respiratory rate and saturating well on room air
throughout his stay on the floor.  While the patient
complained of some runny nose on transfer to the floor, he
developed no other symptoms suggestive of a serious
respiratory infection.  This patient does have previous
hospitalizations because of pneumonia with a question of PCP
pneumonia in the past.

5.  Renal.  The patient had normal creatinine throughout his
hospital stay.  His urinalysis was negative except for a
negative urobilinogen in this patient with advanced liver
disease.  Urine culture was positive for group B Strep which
was an endogenous organism not considered needing to be
treated.

6.  Fluids, Electrolytes and Nutrition.  The patient's lytes
were followed and were repleted while he was on the floor.
Potassium remained slightly low throughout and was repleted
with 40 mEq of KCl during each of his stays on the floor and
was increased to 60 mEq on [**2-17**].  He was maintained on a
low protein diet in light of his elevated ammonia which was
up to 148 on his day of discharge.  He was continued on
thiamine, folate and multivitamin and additional B12 and
folate studies were sent and are still pending.  He tolerated
p.o. liquids and solids well throughout his stay on the
floor.  No complaints of nausea or vomiting.

7.  Gastrointestinal.  In this patient with hepatitis C
positive cirrhosis his albumin came back at 2.8 on [**2177-2-16**].  We continued to follow an ammonia which was 148 prior
to discharge, and lactulose was poorly tolerated by the
patient and was discontinued on his final day of admission.
The patient was requesting therapy options for his liver
disease and seemed most concern with this of his health
issues.  Unfortunately, Interferon therapy may be
contraindicated in this patient on Zoloft with clear symptoms
of depression.  As an outpatient it would be recommended that
he receive vaccination such as hepatitis A in light of his
liver disease.  While this patient has no prior history of
gastrointestinal bleed, we began Imdur for GI prophylaxis,
and it is recommended that he have an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy as an outpatient.

8.  Hematology.  The patient's pan cytopenia was stable while
on the floor.  The patient did complain of a nose bleed one
morning in the setting of low platelet count that he
described as robust, but which stopped easily and did not
recur.  In light of the patient's pan cytopenia which may be
likely due to ethanol use, HIV, liver disease, it was thought
that B12 and folate should also be checked.

9.  Prophylaxis.  The patient remained on heparin subcu
b.i.d. and ranitidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. throughout his stay
on the floor.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was in good condition at
discharge.  He was not complaining of symptoms of alcohol
withdrawal, and was maintained on CIWA protocol greater than
8 during his last three days on the floor.  Methadone
maintenance was restarted with good effect.  He was primarily
concerned with psychosocial issues of maintaining sobriety, a
safe drug-free environment, his chronic health issues, family
stressors, and tomorrow's pending court appearance.
Depression, for these reasons, is a concern in this patient
who appears to have overdosed on narcotics leading to this
admission.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged back to
[**Hospital 10073**] Hospital, where he was first admitted last Monday
([**2177-2-10**]) to begin a detox program prior to this
hospitalization.  He wishes to return to Bornwood to continue
his detox in a safe environment where he can try to address
his recurrent urges for polydrug abuse.  [**Hospital 10073**] Hospital is
located at [**Street Address(2) 10074**] in [**Location (un) **], [**Numeric Identifier 10075**].

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Thiamine 100 mg q. day.
2.  Folic acid 1 mg q. day.
3.  Multivitamin.
4.  Dapsone 100 mg q. day.
5.  Methadone 55 mg q. day.
6.  Fluoxetine 20 mg q. day.
7.  _____ 10 mg b.i.d.
8.  Ativan 1 mg q. 4h. p.r.n.
9.  Clonidine 0.2 mg t.i.d. p.r.n.
10. Potassium chloride 20 mEq b.i.d.
11. Norvasc 2.5 mg p.o. q. day.
12. Magnesium oxide 400 mg p.o. q. day.
13. Imdur 30 mg q. day.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS AND FOLLOW UP:
1.  The patient was instructed to call his primary care
physician, [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **]. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 8271**], after discharge to set up a
follow-up appointment in one week if he desired to continue
having her involved in his care.
2.  As the patient mentioned a desire to transfer his care
from the V.A. Hospital, as he has had some negative
experiences there in the past, we have set up an appointment
for him with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Name (STitle) **] at [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] Associates, [**Hospital1 1444**], for this Thursday, [**2-20**], at 2:00 p.m., the [**Hospital Ward Name 23**] Building.  At this
appointment the patient will be able to follow up his pending
laboratory studies which include pending cultures, his viral
load, his toxoplasmosis cultures.  Also potassium and ammonia
levels should be checked at this time.  As the patient's
blood pressures have been elevated during his hospital stay
and his blood pressure control medications are still being
optimized, his blood pressure should be checked during this
visit and modification of his medical regimen should be
considered.  Pending results of the toxoplasmosis titers, the
patient should be considered for a toxo and [**Doctor First Name **] prophylaxis,
considering his CD4 count of 48.  Also consider a hepatitis A
vaccine and confirm hepatitis B status in this patient.  As
this patient was noted to have a slightly prolonged QT
interval on EKG, it would also be useful to recheck an EKG
during this visit.  While this patient has had no complaints
of gastrointestinal bleed in the past, he should be sent for
endoscopy to look for varices as an outpatient.  The patient
has also been requesting psychiatric and/or social work
support as he has numerous psychosocial stressors and needs a
support network to help him with his depression and with the
numerous issues involving his drug abuse and health care
problems.  This patient should also be set up to be followed
in the [**Hospital3 **].
3.  The patient was also scheduled to visit the Pain Clinic
at [**Hospital1 69**] this Thursday with
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] on [**2-20**] at 12:40 p.m.  This visit is
important in light of his chronic back pain and peripheral
neuropathy, which the patient states have been a factor in
his persistent drug use.
4.  Continue with Methadone maintenance program as previous
to admission.
5.  Consider contacting [**Name (NI) 10076**] for acupuncture treatments as
the patient has requested this therapy which has worked for
him in the past.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Opioid and benzodiazepine intoxication.
2.  Polysubstance abuse.
3.  HIV positive.
4.  Hepatitis C positive.
5.  Hypertension.
6.  Depression.

during AV dysyncrony. IABP was placed [**3-13**] persistent borderline
hypotension. Patient's hemodynamics remained stable and the IABP
was removed approximately 18 hours later.
The patient was noted have brief runs of NSVT on telemetry, in
the range of [**12-4**] beats. These were likely secondary to
reperfusion irritability, and have subsequently subsided without
further intervention.
Echocardiogram revealed anterior wall hypokinesis and apical
akinesis.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
 PREOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  Frontal direct cranial trauma from a fallen pipe
 strike to the forehead.

 POSTOPERATIVE DIAGNOSIS:  No evidence of carotid or vertebral dissection.

 ANESTHESIA:  Conscious sedation and local infiltration of the right groin with
 1% Lidocaine.

 INDICATION:  This is a 44 year old man who suffered an injury on the job with
 the fall of a pipe which struck him in the anterior frontal sinus region.
 Because of the mechanism of injury and the neck extenision involved, the
 discussion was made to perform a cerebral angiogram to rule out evidence of
 carotid vertebral artery injury or dissection.

 CONSENT:  The patient's wife was given a full and complete explanation of the
 procedure including the risks, benefits, and possible complications.  These
 include but are not limited to vessel injury, vessel rupture, stroke,
 infection, coma, and death.  She understood and wished to proceed.

 PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:  The patient was brought into the endovascular suite and
 placed on the table in supine position.  The right and left groin areas were
 prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion and 4 FR vascular sheath was
 inserted into the right common femoral artery.  At this point, a 4 FR
 diagnostic type Berenstein catheter was used to selectively catheterized the
 following vessels over a Terumo guidewire:  Right common carotid artery, right
 internal carotid artery, left common carotid artery, left internal carotid
 artery, right subclavian artery, right vertebral artery, left subclavian
 artery, left vertebral artery.  With the catheter in each of these positions,
 a series of angiographic runs were performed in the single plane, biplane, and
 three dimensional rotational angiography over the cervical and cranial
 regions.  The catheter was then withdrawn from the patient and the vascular
                                                             (Over)

 sheath was removed and manual compression used to achieve hemostasis with the
 aid of a Syvek patch.  The patient tolerated the procedure and returned to the
 surgical intensive care unit in stable condition.

 RESULTS:  Injection of the right and left common carotid artery in the
 cervical region are normal.  Injection of the right and left subclavian
 arteries reveal no evidence of dissection or stenosis of the subclavian
 arteries.  The origin of both vertebral arteries are free of stenotic lesions,
 and the cervical portion of both vertebral arteries are free of intimal
 irregularity or traumatic dissection.  The right and left external carotid
 arteries reveal no evidence of abnormal arteriovenous shunting. Injection of
 the right internal carotid artery reveals a fetal type posterior cerebral
 artery and intracranially there is no evidence of pseudoaneurysm or
 arteriovenous malformation.  Injection of the left internal carotid artery
 reveal no evidence of intracranial aneurysm or arteriovenous malformation and
 show a patent anterior communicating artery with no evidence of abnormal
 dilatation.  Injection of the right and left vertebral artery in the
 intracranial region shows an absence of a right P1 segment and shows a
 duplicated left superior cerebellar system.  The rest of the basilar system
 and its branches are free of aneurysmal dilatation.

 IMPRESSION:  No evidence of carotid or vertebral dissection or injury.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CT SCAN OF THE BRAIN:

 HISTORY:  Follow up study.  Known frontal bone fracture.

 TECHNIQUE:  The entire brain was scanned without IV contrast material.

 FINDINGS:  Comparison with the prior day's study reveals continued evidence
 for the presence of extensive intracranial gas seen anterior to both frontal
 lobes.  There has been little alteration in the extent of the gas.  There is
 no intracranial hemorrhage or shift of normally midline structures.  The
 ventricular size has also not changed in the interval between scans.  The
 lateral scout film clearly shows the depressed fracture of the frontal bone,
 at the level of the frontal sinus.  It should be noted that gas is also seen,
 on both scans, within the right orbit above the muscle cone and in the left
 premaxillary soft tissues.  The gas collections in these locales appear
 unaltered, as well.  The sphenoid sinus, at this time shows a large air fluid
 level with near complete loss of aeration of the sinus.

 CONCLUSION:  Stable intracranial abnormalities as noted above.

 Additional 1.25 mm sections were obtained which extended from the inferior
 aspect of the orbits through the superior aspect of the frontal bone.

 FINDINGS:  The present study redemonstrates the linear fractures which involve
 both the anterior and posterior frontal sinus walls.  An additional area of
 fracture involves the frontal bone near its junction with the anterolateral
 aspect of the orbital roof.  A minute fracture appears to provide
 communication between the right lateral wall of the frontal sinus and the
 collection of right intraorbital gas.  More superiorly, and cephalad to the
 frontal sinus is the actual depressed fracture, which is comminuted with
 approximately 4 mm of depression noted.

 The patient will be brought back for more caudal examination of the facial
 bones, in order to provide multiplanar imaging of the orbital floors.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY: 43 year old man with multiple frontal sinus fractures secondary to
 trauma.

 CT of head without contrast.

 TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast CT of the brain.

 FINDINGS: Comparisons were made to prior studies of [**2148-11-11**] and [**2148-11-12**].

 There is residual intracranial air present. Stable appearance of the brain
 with no mass effect or shift of normally midline structures. No acute
 intracranial hemorrhage is identified. There is persistence of the previously
 noted right intraorbital air. Previously seen fractures through the left
 frontal sinus and the left occiput are again noted. There are fluid
 collections in the frontal and ethmoidal sinuses, which most likely is blood.

 IMPRESSION: No intracranial hemorrhage. Stable appearance of brain.
 Persistence of intraorbital air. Residual intracranial air.

Service:  TRAUMA

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 43 year-old
male with no significant past medical history who was working
on his welding job when a metal object came and hit him in
the forehead.  The patient lost his balance and fell back and
hit the back of his head.  No loss of consciousness at the
scene by report.  On transport to [**Hospital3 3834**] the
patient had loss of consciousness.  Head CT at the outside
hospital showed a frontal bone sinus fracture and
pneumocephalus with a positive occipital fracture.  There was
a question of a contusion versus a bleed in that region.  The
patient had emesis times two.  He was confused and agitated
on arrival to the [**Hospital1 69**].

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  None.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  None.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  None.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Positive marijuana two times per day,
occasional alcohol, occasional tobacco.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 36.7.  Heart rate 80.
Blood pressure 127/67.  Respirations 18.  O2 sat 98%.
General no acute distress.  Pupils are equal, round and
reactive to light.  Face was symmetric.  Tongue midline.
Laceration on the forehead, which was sutured.  Heart is
regular rate and rhythm.  Lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdomen soft, nontender, nondistended.  Pelvis
is stable.  Extremities no gross deformities.  Palpable
dorsalis pedis pulse and posterior tibial pulse bilaterally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Hematocrit 40, white blood cell count 20,
platelets 234, sodium 139, potassium 3.6, chloride 104,
bicarbonate 23, BUN 14, creatinine .9, glucose 196, blood gas
on admission was 7.35/44/127/22/-1.  Head CT at the outside
hospital showed a frontal bone sinus fracture with
pneumocephalus and also an occipital fracture.  At this
institution C spine plain films were negative.  Chest x-ray
was negative.  Pelvis x-ray was negative.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient was admitted to the Trauma
Surgery Service.  He had a four vessel angiogram performed on
[**11-11**], which showed no evidence of carotid dissection,
no evidence of vertebral dissection and no evidence of
intracranial vascular pathology.  He was admitted for
neurological checks and started on Clindamycin.  He was
placed in the Intensive Care Unit for neurological checks.  A
CT of his head was stable and CT C spine revealed no obvious
pathology.  A repeat CT on [**11-15**] showed decrease in air in
bifrontal areas and the patient's neurological examination
was stable.  He was tolerating a regular diet at the time of
discharge.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home with follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1327**]
from neurosurgery.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
Status post trauma with pneumocephalus and occipital bone
fracture along with frontal bone sinus fracture.

 basal ganglia,frontal and temporal lobes with intraventricular extension.
 There is midline shift of approximately 8.8 mm with effacement of the
 ipsilateral ventricle. There is mild trapping of the contralateral ventricle.
 There are confluent hypodensities in the periventricular and subcortical white
 matter compatible with small vessel ischemia in a patient of this age group.
 There is a prominent right frontal extra-axial space. There are secretions in
 the right maxillary sinus.
