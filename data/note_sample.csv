                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY: Severe abdominal pain, hypotension.  Please assess the aorta with a
 non-contrast scan.

 TECHNIQUE: Helically acquired contiguous axial images were obtained through
 the abdomen and pelvis, without the administration of IV or oral contrast, as
 per the request of the emergency room attending physician caring for the
 patient.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There are incompletely imaged coronary
 artery calcifications.  There is dependent atelectasis within the visualized
 portions of the lung bases.  The liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and
 right kidney are unremarkable. The gallbladder is distended.  There is an
 approximately 5 cm exophytic simple cyst in the upper pole of the left kidney.
 The left kidney is otherwise unremarkable.  There are diffuse vascular
 calcifications throughout the abdomen. There is diffuse calcification of the
 intra-abdominal aorta and common iliac arteries.  There is no evidence,
 however, of aneurysmal dilatation of the aorta or gross dissection (this is a
 limited assessment for dissection, given the non-contrast nature of this
 examination).  There is no free air, free fluid, or lymphadenopathy within the
 abdomen.  The unopacified loops of large/small bowel are unremarkable. There
 is no evidence of bowel obstruction.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Again noted are diffuse vascular
 calcifications.  A Foley catheter is seen within a collapsed urinary bladder.
 There are multiple sigmoid diverticula without evidence of associated
 inflammatory changes.  The rectum and visualized loops of bowel are
 unremarkable.  There is an enlarged and partially calcified prostate gland.
 There is no free air or free fluid within the pelvis.

 Bone windows demonstrate diffuse degenerative changes of the visualized spine.
 There is a solitary bone island of the right ischium.  The osseous structures
 are otherwise unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. Limited non-contrast examination demonstrates diffuse vascular
 calcifications, but no evidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid.

Neuro: Pt is restless at times with some movements in all extremities but does not follow my commands to squeeze my hand or open his eyes. Pupils are 4MM equal and reactive to light bilaterally. His sedation had been off since the day shift and he was getting more and more restless and coughing and chewing on the ETT constantly. After discussion with team the decision was made to use PRN ativan boluses which have been effective to keep him more comfortable.

Resp: Remains on AC 18, TV 600, FIO2 40% with 8cm peep. Good sats. Stable gas. Suctioned frequently in the beginning of the shift. He has mod amts thick pale yellow secretions via the ETT as well as orally. Lungs are coarse.

Cardiac: Weaned off the levophed by mid-shift. BP 90-130/60. GOAL MAP >60. Also lido drip shut off and pt bolused with amiodarone 150mg then started on infusion of amio at 1mg/min which should be changed to .5mg/min at 11:15PM. He needs the amiodarone at .5mg/min continuously for 18hrs then they will assess if he can be switched to PO regimen. He has had much less ectopy and no runs of VT since starting the amio drip. He tolerated the bolus well without hypotension. His triponin came back greater than 50 today so he is being treated for acute MI. He was given aspirin one tab via the NGT and started on heparin drip. No bolus was given. Infusion started at 6:30PM so he needs PTT at 12:30PM. The heparin sliding scale is in the orders and drip needs to be adjusted according the scale. His swan numbers show SVR 900. CO 5.4. PCW 18-22.

Skin: Dressing on his right toes and left heal and side of foot changed. Areas look necrotic.

Social: Large family who are very involved. Pt apparently has had poor quality of life recently with mild alzheimer's dementia, poor circulation, neuropathy, diabetes and spent the major part of his life in bed these days. They are comfortable with their decision for DNR and even question whether we should continue to be as aggressive as we are. I can tell they struggle with their decision but reassured them that right now there is no decisions to be made and just give him time to see which direction he goes.

Neuro: Pt alert, follows commands at the beginning of the shift. Opens eyes to commands. He denied pain at 8PM but did c/o discomfort and requested something to relax him. He was given 2mg IV ativan and did well. No further sedation required overnight. Pt MAE. Nods ead to questions. Has good cough and gag. His family say his baseline is pleasant but forgetful. He does reach to pull out the ETT when left untied so he is restained for safety.

Cardiac: BP stable 120-130/60. Pt is on Amiodarone via NGT TID. Tolerating this well. HR 80-95 most of the shift. Has rare to occ. PVC/APC.

He remains on heparin drip which needed to be decreased to 750u/hr at 11PM for PTT 110. Repeat PTT will be sent at 5AM.

Resp: Stable gas on AC 14, TV 500, FIO2 30% with 5cm peep. Plan to put pt on PSV early today and try to extubate him. The team needs to meet with the family and decide on if he wil be reintubated if he fails. He has been suctioned for thick pale yellow to white secretions. Lungs are coarse.

GI: Pt is NPO except for meds. +BS noted. No stool.

GU: UO excellent via foley. Urine is cloudy/sedimented.

ID: Pt is afebrile. Lactic acid is 1.0. He continues on vanco/fluconozole/zosyn.

Skin: Pt has bad necrotic coccyx area noted with open bleeding areas. I applied collaginase to the area but it needs to be seen by team today. I took off a duoderm that was falling off the wound. His incisions on his left leg are red and swolloen somewhat. No drainage noted. I dressed his feet wounds as orderd. No change in these wounds noted. They too have necrosis noted.

Social: Family has been in aggreement that pt does not have good quality of life now at his baseline and they have been discussing with team about withdrawal of care. Further decisions regarding this matter need to be addressed today prior to extubation. He remains full treat but DNR until then.

 FINDINGS: A single AP supine image. Comparison study dated [**2101-10-24**]. There is
 again evidence of moderate LV enlargement associated with prominence of the
 pulmonary vessels and blurring of vascular detail at the bases. There is also
 blunting of both costophrenic angles consistent with bilateral pleural
 effusions. These findings indicate left heart failure of moderate severity.
 The changes may be slightly worse than on the previous day. There is
 persistent left lower lobe collapse/consolidation. The aorta is slightly
 unfolded. The right IJ central line remains in good position.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is retired and had been living
at home with his wife prior to his admission to the hospital
on [**2101-10-11**]; he had been living at [**Hospital3 1761**] for the day prior to admission.  He is a
social drinker and has a 40-pack-year smoking history;
although, he quit smoking 20 years ago.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:   Initial physical
examination revealed temperature was 96.1 degrees Fahrenheit,
heart rate was 83, blood pressure was 124/42 (following
administration of 3 liters of normal saline), respiratory
was 24, and his oxygen saturation was 100% on 2 liters nasal
cannula.  His heart had a regular rate and rhythm.  There
were normal first and second heart sounds.  There was a 2/6
systolic ejection murmur, and there were no rubs or gallops.
His lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  His
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended, and there were
hypoactive bowel sounds.  He had a palpable bypass graft
pulse, [**Hospital3 17394**] dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis
pulses bilaterally; and his surgical incision was clean, dry,
and intact.  Please note that the above examination was done
by the Vascular Surgery team, which was the team that was
initially planning to admit the patient to the hospital.

PERTINENT LABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On initial
laboratory evaluation the patient had a white blood cell
count of 12.7, hematocrit was 30.2, and platelets
were 282,000.  His PT was 13.5, PTT was 30.7, and INR
was 1.3.  His serum chemistries revealed sodium was 136,
potassium was 5.4, chloride was 99, bicarbonate was 25, blood
urea nitrogen was 53, creatinine was 3.2, and blood glucose
was 91.  His calcium was 8.2, magnesium was 2.4, and
phosphate was 4.8.  Blood cultures drawn on admission were
pending, but ultimately negative.  A urine culture taken on
admission was initially pending, but ultimately grew out
yeast.  A sputum culture taken on admission was also
initially pending, but ultimately also grew out yeast.

RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  His admission chest x-ray demonstrated
stable prominence of the right main pulmonary artery; no
focal areas of consolidation; overall stable appearance of
the chest compared with a [**2101-10-15**] study.  No
radiographic evidence of congestive heart failure or
pneumonia.

His admission electrocardiogram demonstrated a sinus rhythm,
nonspecific inferior/lateral T wave changes, low QRS voltages
in the limb leads, and T wave changes in V5 and V6 when
compared with an electrocardiogram dated [**2101-10-12**].

An initial abdominal CT was a limited noncontrast examination
that demonstrated diffuse vascular calcifications.  No
evidence of an abdominal aortic aneurysm or free fluid,
incompletely imaged coronary artery calcification, a simple
left renal cyst, sigmoid diverticulosis, and an enlarged and
partially calcified prostate gland.

HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM:

1.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  The patient was initially admitted to
the Vascular Intensive Care Unit with hypotension, decreased
urine output, and acute renal failure; most likely secondary
to a presumed gram-negative urosepsis (although there were
never any positive culture data to confirm this diagnosis).

While boarding in the Medical Intensive Care Unit on the
night of admission, the patient had a sudden
cardiorespiratory arrest.  He was resuscitated with
epinephrine, lidocaine, and direct current cardioversion
times four.  He was also intubate for airway protection.

Following these measures, the patient returned to a sinus
rhythm with a systolic blood pressure of approximately 100;
the total time elapsed from the beginning of the arrest to
the return of a pulse was approximately 16 minutes.  He
subsequently required double pressors to maintain his blood
pressure.

An echocardiogram performed at the bedside demonstrated a
trivial pericardial effusion and a left ventricular ejection
fraction of 20% to 25% in the setting of tachycardia and a
hyperdynamic right ventricle; suggesting elevated right-sided
filling pressures.  Although the definitive etiology of this
arrest remained unknown, the most likely trigger was a
non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, as his troponin values were
elevated to greater than 50 following his arrest.

A repeat echocardiogram done on [**2101-10-21**]
demonstrated mild left atrial dilation, an ejection fraction
of 15% to 20%, resting regional wall motion abnormalities
including inferior, mid, and apical left ventricular
akinesis, depressed right ventricular systolic function, and
moderate mitral regurgitation.  Compared with the prior study
of [**2101-10-20**]; the left ventricular function was
unchanged.  There was moderate mitral regurgitation, and the
right ventricular function appeared worse.

On [**2101-10-21**], the patient was loaded with amiodarone
and was subsequently started on oral amiodarone.  The
following day, he was started on heparin intravenously given
his elevated serum troponin to greater than 50; this
medication was continued for 72 hours.  Given his elevated
troponins and non-Q-wave myocardial infarction, the patient
was a candidate for cardiac catheterization.

After discussions between the Medical Intensive Care Unit
team and the patient's family, however, the decision was made
to not pursue further invasive procedures given that the
patient had been made do not resuscitate/do not intubate
following the resuscitation mentioned above, and his family
no longer wished for aggressive resuscitating measures.

By [**2101-10-23**], he was off pressors and he was
restarted on a beta blocker and ACE inhibitor at low doses.

On the evening of [**2101-10-25**], the patient complained
of substernal chest pain that was relieved by NPG SL and
morphine.  He also had ST segment depressions in V2 and V3
that reverted to baseline after the resolution of his pain.
Therefore, the patient was again started on heparin;
although, this was discontinued on [**2101-10-26**] when
the patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac
enzymes.  He again had substernal chest pain on [**2101-10-27**]; although, he had no electrocardiogram changes, and he
again ruled out for a myocardial infarction by cardiac
enzymes.

By hospital day four, the patient began to develop evidence
of congestive heart failure given his aggressive fluid
resuscitation, and gentle diuresis with furosemide was begun.
By the time of his transfer to the General Medicine Service
on [**2101-10-26**], the patient was still significantly
volume overloaded following his aggressive fluid
resuscitation in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Therefore,
he was continued on the program of gentle diuresis given that
he was having signs and symptoms of right-sided congestive
heart failure.  He achieved adequate diuresis by the time of
his discharge to rehabilitation, as his oxygen saturation was
greater than 95% on 2 liters nasal cannula.

2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE/SEPSIS:  The patient was started on
gentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam in addition to the
levofloxacin, metronidazole, and vancomycin he was already
taking for right lower extremity cellulitis prior to
admission for empiric coverage of a presumed gram-negative
urosepsis, and he was aggressively hydrated with intravenous
fluids.

On [**2101-10-21**], his levofloxacin and metronidazole was
discontinued, and he was started on fluconazole given the
growth of yeast on urine culture.  He was taken off of
gentamicin on hospital day three, and his fluconazole was
discontinued on hospital day five (as per the Infectious
Disease Service).  He was taken off of vancomycin on
[**2101-10-28**], and his piperacillin/tazobactam was
discontinued on [**2101-10-29**].

Despite the presumption of a gram-negative urosepsis
precipitating this admission, the patient did not have any
positive blood or urine cultures aside from the growth of
yeast in two urine cultures noted above.  He remained
afebrile both before and after discontinuation of his
antibiotics, and he was found to be Clostridium difficile
negative on [**2101-10-28**].

3.  PULMONARY:  As noted above, the patient was intubated and
he was extubated on [**2101-10-24**].  He subsequently
developed wheezing and mild hypoxia; most likely secondary to
cardiac asthma and fluid overload in the setting of his
aggressive fluid resuscitation.  He was gently diuresed
toward the end of his hospitalization, and by the time of his
he was maintaining an oxygen saturation of greater than 95%
on 2 liters nasal cannula, intermittent ipratropium
nebulizers, and chest physical therapy for clearance of his
respiratory secretions.

4.  RENAL:  The patient presented with acute renal failure
and prerenal azotemia that rapidly resolved following fluid
resuscitation.  By the time of discharge, his serum
creatinine was stable and at his preadmission baseline.

5.  NUTRITION:  The patient was found to be profoundly
malnourished with a serum albumin of 1.8 on admission.  Once
he was extubated and taking orals, he performed poorly on a
modified barium swallowing study and was started on a thin
liquid, ground-solid diet with whole medication tablets,
small bites and sips, upright posture with meals, and
aspiration precautions.  He was also given ProMod shakes with
and between meals for nutritional supplementation of his
heart-healthy/diabetic diet.

6.  VASCULAR:  The patient's operative incisions and foot
ulcers continued to heal throughout this admission.  He was
started on an multivitamin, vitamin C, and zinc for improved
wound healing.

7.  HEMATOLOGY:  The patient was transfused one unit of
packed red blood cells on [**2101-10-27**] to maintain a
hematocrit of greater than 30 given his history of severe
coronary artery disease.  His hematocrit subsequently
remained stable.

 INDICATION: Surveillance of a left superficial femoral artery (SFA)-to-
 anterior tibial artery ([**Doctor First Name **]) bypass.

 TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS: [**Doctor Last Name **]-scale ultrasonography, color Doppler ultrasound
 examination, and analysis of spectral Doppler waveforms were performed at the
 level of the graft as well as the native arteries downstream and upstream.

 This showed a patent bypass, with a proximal diameter of 0.60 cm and a distal
 diameter of 0.58 cm. The peak systolic velocities are measured at 122
 cm/second in the native left common femoral artery, 157 cm/second at the
 proximal bypass anastomosis, values ranging between 35 cm/second and 58
 cm/second in the graft itself, 81 cm/second at the distal bypass anastomosis,
 and 77 cm/ second in the native anterior tibial artery, beyond the bypass.

 CONCLUSION: Patent left SFA to [**Doctor First Name **] bypass, without any significant stenosis.

 ARTERIAL DUPLEX LOWER EXTREMITY:

 REASON:  Patient s/p left lower extremity bypass graft, perform follow up
 surveillance.

 FINDINGS:  Duplex evaluation was performed in the left lower extremity from
 femoral vein to tibial artery bypass graft.  The peak systolic velocities in
 cm/sec. are as follows:  101, 108, 119, 91 in the native proximal vessel,
 proximal anasatomosis, distal anastomosis and native distal vessel
 respectively.  Throughout the body of the graft velocities range from 34
 through 101.  At the area just proximal to the distal anastomosis there is one
 peak velocity ratio greater than 2.  However, the peak systolic velocity at
 this location is only 101 cm/sec.

 IMPRESSION:  Widely patent left superficial femoral artery to anterior tibial
 artery bypass graft.  Throughout the body of the graft most of the velocities
 are in the high 30's to 40 range which can be seen in distal tibial bypass
 grafts.  As noted there is one area where a peak velocity ratio is greater
 than 2.  This is consistent with approximately a 50% stenosis at this area.
 However as noted above the gross peak systolic velocity at this location is
 only 101 cm/sec.

TRICUSPID VALVE: There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: The pulmonic valve leaflets appear
structurally normal with physiologic pulmonic regurgitation.

PERICARDIUM: There is no pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor subcostal views. The
echocardiographic results were reviewed by telephone with the houseofficer
caring for the patient.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation. No masses or vegetations are
seen on the aortic valve. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.
There is no mitral valve prolapse. No mass or vegetation is seen on the mitral
valve. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. A catheter is seen in the right
atrium with intermittent herniation through the tricuspid annulus. An
associated vegetation/thrombus cannot be excluded. There is mild pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

If the clinical suspicion for endocarditis is moderate/high, a TEE is
suggested to better define the right atrial catheter.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Shortness of breath and fevers.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47-year-old
female with a history of human immunodeficiency virus (last
CD4 count 42 and a viral load of 65,000), cirrhosis,
diabetes, and hypothyroidism presented with eight days of
fevers to 104, chills, shortness of breath, cough, dyspnea on
exertion, and fatigue.

The patient states she has become progressively dyspneic to
the point where she is short of breath with speaking.  She
has also had night sweats for the past two days and whitish
sputum.  She complains of myalgias.  No recent ill contacts.
[**Name (NI) **] known tuberculosis exposure.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was initially 96% on
room air, with a respiratory rate of 20, and a heart rate of
117.  A chest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial opacities.
She received 3 liters of normal saline, clindamycin, and
primaquine for likely Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  She
spiked a temperature to 102.1 and became progressively
dyspneic with her respiratory rate increasing to 40, and her
oxygen saturations dropping to 89% on room air.  She was
placed on 6 liters by nasal cannula, and an arterial blood
gas showed 7.47/28/74.  The patient was given prednisone and
aztreonam for possible cholangitis.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On admission, the
patient had a temperature of 102.1, her heart rate was 118,
her respiratory rate was 40, her blood pressure was 117/57,
and her oxygen saturation was 89% on room air and 94% on 6
liters.  In general, she was ill and toxic appearing.  She
was unable to speak in complete sentences.  She was
cachectic.  Head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat examination
revealed anicteric.  The mucous membranes were dry.  The
extraocular movements were intact.  No thrush.  The neck was
supple.  There was no jugular venous distention.  Thorax
revealed bilateral basilar rales.  No wheezes.
Cardiovascular examination revealed tachycardia.  There were

Pulses were 2+.  Neurologic examination revealed cranial
nerves II through XII were intact.  Strength was [**5-18**] in all
extremities.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  The patient had
a white blood cell count of 9.7 (with 89% neutrophils and 7%
lymphocytes), and her hematocrit was 34.2.  Chemistries were
within normal limits with a blood urea nitrogen of 9 and a
creatinine of 0.5.  Her aspartate aminotransferase was 69,
her alanine-aminotransferase was 28, her alkaline phosphatase
was 994, and her total bilirubin was 2.2, and her direct
bilirubin was 1.5.  Her lactate was 2.1.  Urinalysis was
negative for leukocyte esterase or nitrites.  It was positive
for 30 protein.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  An electrocardiogram revealed
sinus tachycardia; unchanged from [**2187**].

A chest x-ray revealed bilateral interstitial opacities in
the left mid lung; consistent with Pneumocystis carinii
pneumonia or viral pneumonia.

A right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed no cholelithiasis.
No gallbladder wall edema.  Common bile duct was 4 mm.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:

1.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  From the Emergency Room, the patient
was transferred to the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit secondary
to respiratory distress.  Symptoms consistent with a
respectively alkalosis.  A chest x-ray was consistent with
possible Pneumocystis pneumonia versus a viral pneumonia.

Given her allergies to both sulfa and dapsone, she was
started on empiric Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia coverage
with primaquine and clindamycin.  She was also started on
prednisone given her low oxygen saturations, and given her
low PAO2.

In the [**Hospital Ward Name 332**] Intensive Care Unit, she requested noninvasive
positive pressure ventilation.  A bronchoscopy was performed
with 1+ gram-positive cocci in pairs and positive
Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  Acid-fast bacillus smears
were negative.

The patient's respiratory status continued to improve on her
medication regimen.  She was weaned off of the noninvasive
positive pressure ventilation and eventually was able to
saturate 98% on room air.  She was to be continued on
primaquine and clindamycin for a total of a 21-day course of
antibiotics as well as a 21-day steroid taper.

2.  BACTEREMIA ISSUES:  The patient's blood cultures from
admission from [**3-15**] and [**3-16**] grew out
methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus ([**4-19**] blood
cultures).  At that time, the patient was started on
vancomycin therapy with quick clearance of her blood
cultures.

A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed to rule out
endocarditis, and it did not show any valvular abnormalities;
although, the tricuspid valve was obscured by her
peripherally inserted central catheter line.  The subsequent
surveillance blood cultures from [**3-17**] on were negative,
and the patient was to be continued on vancomycin
intravenously for a 3-week course.  After that time, blood
cultures should be repeated for surveillance.  The patient
remained afebrile during the remainder of her hospital stay.

3.  CIRRHOSIS ISSUES:  The patient has Child A class
cirrhosis from a liver biopsy done in [**2190-10-13**].  Her
cirrhosis was thought to be secondary to her highly active
antiretroviral therapy.  She was to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**]
in [**2191-4-14**] for a visit.

A right upper quadrant ultrasound was performed as the
patient's alanine-aminotransferase was slightly elevated and
was within normal limits.

4.  HUMAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS ISSUES:  The patient was
restarted on her highly active antiretroviral therapy regimen
on hospital day four.  The patient tolerated these
medications without any problems.  She was also continued on
acyclovir and fluconazole for prophylaxis.  The patient was
to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 20066**] in clinic over the next two
weeks.

5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on
original regimen of Lantus without a sliding-scale secondary
to her steroid taper.  Her blood sugars remained elevated
while in house; ranging from the 200s to the 400s.  Her
Lantus was increased to 12 units subcutaneously in the
morning, and her sliding-scale was increased as well with
improved blood sugars.  She was to be discharged on 12 units
of Lantus in the morning with a strict sliding-scale for the
next three days until her prednisone is tapered; at which
time her Lantus will be decreased to 7 units in the morning,
and her sliding-scale will be decreased as well.

6.  HYPOTHYROIDISM ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her
Levoxyl.

7.  ACCESS ISSUES:  A peripherally inserted central catheter
line was placed on [**2191-3-19**] for intravenous antibiotics.
It was found to be in the right atrium on chest x-ray and was
pulled back 6 cm with a repeat chest x-ray location in the
superior vena cava.  She will need the peripherally inserted
central catheter line for 14 more days as she finishes her
course of intravenous vancomycin.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was good.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to home.

DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS/FOLLOWUP:  The patient was instructed
to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 497**] for cirrhosis and with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) 20066**] for her human immunodeficiency virus.  She was to
follow up with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] and Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 4390**] next
Friday for primary care.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
 1.  Prednisone 40 mg once per day times three days; then 20
mg once per day times 11 days.
 2.  Acyclovir 200 mg by mouth twice per day.
 3.  Fluconazole 200 mg by mouth twice per day.
 4.  Primaquine 26.3 two tablets by mouth every day (times 14
days).

three days; and then 7 units subcutaneously in the morning.
10.  Regular insulin sliding-scale as directed (per
sliding-scale).
11.  Clindamycin 300 mg by mouth four times per day (times 14
days).
12.  Vancomycin 750 mg intravenously twice per day (times 14
days).
13.  Codeine/guaifenesin syrup 5 cc to 10 cc by mouth q.6h.
as needed.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  HIV/AIDS.  Right lower quadrant pain with rebound tenderness.

 TECHNIQUE:  Axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were acquired without IV
 contrast secondary to patient contrast allergy.

 NON-CONTRAST ABDOMINAL CT:  There is some dependent changes in the lung bases,
 but no pleural or pericardial effusions.  Evaluation of solid abdominal organs
 is limited without IV contrast.  Allowing for the limitations, no focal
 hepatic splenic, or renal lesions are identified.  The gallbladder is
 collapsed, but there is fluid surrounding the gallbladder and in the
 gallbladder fossa.  Low attenuation fluid is present surrounding the liver,
 and within the pelvis.  The pancreas, adrenal glands, and stomach are
 unremarkable.  All small bowel loops are normal in caliber.  There is some
 mild mesenteric stranding.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is fluid in the pelvis, with
 ascending colonic wall thickening, with surrounding stranding.  No
 pathologically enlarged inguinal or pelvic nodes are seen.  The sigmoid colon
 and rectum are unremarkable.

 BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic osseous lesions are
 identified.

 IMPRESSION:  New ascitic fluid around the liver, and descending pericolic
 gutter, and in pelvis, with ascending colonic wall thickening and adjacent
 stranding.  Given the patient's HIV status, the findings are likely due to
 infection.

 Results were discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 70627**] [**Name (STitle) **], at 4:15pm on [**2191-4-15**].

 Compared to previous study of [**2191-4-11**].

 INDICATION: HIV+ with history of PCP and worsening cough.

 The heart size, mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. There is a subtle
 hazy area of increased opacity within the left lung adjacent to the left heart
 border, which results in obscuration of a very small portion of the left heart
 border. The lungs otherwise appear clear, and no pleural effusions are
 identified. Skeletal structures are unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION: Possible very early lingular pneumonia. Follow up radiographs may
 be helpful in this regard.

 HISTORY:  HIV positive patient with lingular opacity on prior study.

 COMPARISON:  [**2191-5-16**].

 FINDINGS:  AP portable upright view.  The study is technically suboptimal due
 to a cluster of wires overlying and partially obscuring the left hemithorax.

 The heart and mediastinum appear stable.  There are bilateral, predominantly
 perihilar and basilar interstitial opacities.  The right basilar opacity is
 slightly more prominent than the left.  These findings are suggestive of
 atypical pneumonia. Volume overload is less likely. There are no pleural
 effusions. The visualized osseous structures are grossly unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral interstitial opacities suggestive of atypical
 pneumonia.  Volume overload is less likely.

 COMPARISON:  [**2191-4-15**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Helically-acquired axial images were obtained through the abdomen
 and pelvis following the administration of PO contrast.  IV contrast was not
 administered due to the patient's reported anaphylatic reaction to IV
 contrast.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There are small bilateral pleural
 effusions.  On this non-enhanced CT, the liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal
 glands, kidneys and ureters and gallbladder are essentially unchanged in
 appearance.  There is still some evidence of fluid around the gallbladder.
 There is persistent fluid around the liver and spleen, extending in both
 paracolic gutters.  There is also fluid within the mesentery.  There are no
 identified enlarged lymph nodes.  No free air within the abdomen.  The small
 bowel is unremarkable in appearance.  The descending and transverse colon are
 probably normal in appearance.  There is wall thickening of the cecum and
 ascending colon, with some adjacent stranding.  This is not significantly
 changed compared to the prior study.  There is no identified abscess.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is still a significant amount of
 free fluid within the pelvis, and this may have slightly increased compared to
 the prior study.  The rectum and sigmoid colon are normal in appearance. There
 is evidence of edema within the subcutaneous tissues.  No pathologically
 enlarged inguinal lymph nodes are identified.  The bladder and uterus are
 unremarkable.

 BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious osteolytic or sclerotic lesions.

 IMPRESSION:  Persistent ascites within the abdomen and pelvis with thickening
 of the cecum and ascending colonic wall and stranding.  These findings are
 similar to the prior study and are likely due to an infectious etiology, given
 the patient's history.  No focal abscess is identified.  No evidence of free
 air.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2 weighted images were obtained prior to the
 administration of contrast.  Dynamic gadolinium enhanced 3D gradient echo T1
 weighted images were obtained.

 FINDINGS:  There is hepatosplenomegaly.  There is no intrahepatic or
 extrahepatic biliary dilatation.  The portal vein is patent with hepatopetal
 flow.  The hepatic veins are all patent.  The gallbladder is contracted.  The
 wall of the gallbladder is mildly thickened, however, this is nonspecific,
 especially in a contracted gallbladder.  There is no evidence of gallstones.
 The pancreatic duct appears within normal limits.  There are no filling
 defects within the biliary tree or pancreatic duct.  The pancreatic parenchyma
 appears within normal limits.  The adrenal glands appear within normal limits.

 The kidneys are enlarged bilaterally.  There is a striated nephrogram
 appearance on delayed post contrast images.  In the right upper pole of the
 kidney medially, there is a 1.8 x 1.7 cm lesion which is hyperintense on T2
 weighted images and hypointense on T1 weighted images.  This demonstrates rim
 enhancement and lack of enhancement centrally.  These findings are consistent
 with a focal abscess in the setting of pyelonephritis.  Clinical correlation
 is recommended.  These findings were merely discussed with the house staff.
 The left kidney also demonstrates an appearance consistent with pyelonephritis
 without evidence of abscess.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  Findings highly suggestive of bilateral pyelonephritis with focal abscess
 in the right kidney upper pole. However, these findings are not entirely
 specific and should be correlated with clinical findings.

 2.  Normal appearance of the biliary tree.

 CHEST, UPRIGHT AP PORTABLE:  Comparison is made to [**2175-5-30**].  The patient has
 been extubated.  The tip of the right internal jugular central venous catheter
 is unchanged, probably residing at the cavoatrial junction or upper right
 atrium, although it is not well assessed because of low lung volumes.  The
 cardiac and mediastinal contours are unchanged, allowing for differences in
 technique. There is persistent left lower lobe opacity obscuring the left lung
 base, which could represent either atelectasis or consolidation.  In addition,
 there is a new possible left upper lobe infiltrate, which is vaguely defined.
 There is no evidence of fluid overload or CHF.

 IMPRESSION:  New vague left upper lobe infiltrate, for which a follow-up
 radiograph is recommended to exclude new consolidation.  Otherwise, no
 significant change or evidence of fluid overload.

 RENAL TRANSPLANT ULTRASOUND:  Anterior to the transplant is a new 7.6 x 3.5 cm
 fluid collection.  The kidney demonstrates normal arterial and venous
 waveforms with resistive indices ranging from 0.77 to 0.84.  There is a
 prominent area in the lateral aspect of the mid pole, which likely represents
 an artifact as normal blood flow is demonstrated to this region.  There is no
 evidence of hydronephrosis or stones.

 IMPRESSION:  Normal arterial and venous color blood flow and waveform with
 normal resistive indices.  7.6 x 3.5 cm fluid collection, likely simple fluid
 anterior to the transplant.  Focal area of heterogeneity within the lateral
 aspect of the mid pole, which demonstrates normal blood flow and may represent
 artifact, however, attention to this area on follow-up scans is recommended to
 document interval change or resolution.

 COMPARISON:  [**2175-6-2**].

 Grayscale and Doppler son[**Name (NI) 899**] of the right common femoral, superficial
 femoral, and popliteal veins were performed.  A hematoma is again noted within
 the right groin, measuring 2.0 x 2.7 x 3.1 cm in greatest dimensions, and is
 likely not significantly changed from the prior study, though the hematoma was
 not optimally imaged on the prior exam.  There is normal flow within the
 proximal-most right common femoral vein, though within the distal portion of
 the right common femoral vein and throughout the course of the right
 superficial femoral vein, there are internal echoes and expansion of the
 vessel, without flow, consistent with thrombus.  A very small amount of flow
 is seen distally within the right superficial femoral vein, and the right
 popliteal vein is patent and compressible.  Normal flow and waveforms are
 noted within the right common femoral artery.

 As DVT was noted within the right lower extremity, the left lower extremity
 was examined.  There is normal flow, augmentation, compressibility, and
 waveforms within the left common femoral vein, superficial femoral vein, and
 popliteal vein.

 IMPRESSION:  Acute deep venous thrombosis, within the right common femoral and
 superficial femoral veins, that has developed since [**2175-6-2**].  There is a
 right groin hematoma, unchanged.

 The findings were immediately discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 6485**], at the conclusion of

ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS:  End stage renal disease, admitted for
transplant surgery.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 65 year-old
woman with end stage renal disease, secondary to malignant
hypertension. She was started on dialysis in [**2174-2-7**].  She currently was on peritoneal dialysis and appears
to be doing well.  She has a history of gastric angiectasia
which she requires endoscopy. She was admitted on [**2175-5-30**] for
a scheduled living donor kidney transplant by her son, who is
the donor.  She does have a donor specific antibody (B-51)
and will have a final T & B cell class match prior to
transplantation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  End stage renal disease, secondary to
malignant hypertension on dialysis.  History of anemia
following gastric angiectasia.  She has no known history for
coronary artery disease for diabetes.

ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:  Unknown.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Married, lives with her husband.  She has a
history of a half pack of cigarettes per day for 20 years.
Occasional alcohol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient was afebrile.  Vital signs
were stable. Blood pressure was 124/58; heart rate 76; weight
160 pounds. Abdomen soft and nontender.  She has a peritoneal
dialysis catheter in the right lower quadrant. She has good
femoral pulses bilaterally. Mild pedal edema.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2175-5-30**], the patient went to the
operating room for living donor kidney transplant, performed
by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and assisting by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Please see details
of this surgery in operating room note. Also during her
operating room time, the patient also had a right iliac
artery thrombosis.  It was noted that at the end of the
completion of the procedure, that she had an ischemic
appearing right foot and absence of a right femoral pulse. In
the operation, there was some difficulty with arterial
anastomosis, renal artery to the left iliac artery and Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **] came to assist Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  Again, please see
details of that operation in the operative report.

Postoperatively, the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit.
The patient had an A line, a central line, Foley. She was
placed on a heparin drip to keep PTT between 45 and 50.  The
patient's dressing was clean, dry and intact. The patient had
2 [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drains in place.  Good femoral pulse and good
dorsalis pedis pulse.  These pulses were palpable.  The
patient was making good urine output postoperatively.  Renal
was consulted and made recommendations.  Postoperatively, the
patient had a renal ultrasound demonstrating an unremarkable
renal transplant ultrasound with normal size and appearance
of the transplanted kidney and normal arterial wave forms and
resistive disease, ranging from 0.63 to 0.75 throughout.

On postoperative day number one, the patient had another
ultrasound secondary to her hematocrit decreasing and they
wanted to rule out hematoma. The ultrasound demonstrated that
there was no hematoma seen adjacent to the transplanted
kidney. The transplanted kidney is minimally changed from
yesterday which was on [**2175-5-30**] with a small amount of pelvic
ectasis.  Relatively unchanged resistive indices.  The
patient did get multiple transfusions for her low hematocrit.
Her heparin was discontinued on [**2175-6-1**]. The patient received
1/2 cc per cc of replacement and on [**6-1**], Tacrolimus was
started.  On [**2175-6-2**], the patient had some complaint of right
foot numbness. Lower extremity ultrasound was obtained to
rule out deep venous thrombosis and this showed no evidence
of right lower extremity deep venous thrombosis.  On [**2175-6-2**],
WBC was 2.9, hematocrit of 35.2. Also on [**6-2**], PT was 13.5,
PTT was 36.7, INR of 1.2.  Sodium that day was 129 and 4.4,
100 BUN, creatinine of 69 and 6.2 with a glucose of 96.

Vascular surgery continued to see the patient.  It was
decided that hematocrit was stable, that heparin could be
continued. The patient was restarted on heparin.  The patient
still complained of right foot numbness but it was about the
same and not worse.  She was continued on all of her
immunosuppressive medications, including Tacrolimus, Valcyte,
Cellcept, Bactrim, Solu-Medrol.  The patient was transitioned
from heparin to Coumadin.  The patient was transferred to the
floor, continued to make excellent urine output.  The patient
had another ultrasound on [**2175-6-6**] because there was blood in
her [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 1661**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1662**] drain and with the decreasing hematocrit.
Ultrasound demonstrated normal arterial and venous color,
blood flow and wave form with normal residual indices.  7.6
by 3.5 cm fluid collection, likely simply fluid, anterior to
the contrast. Focal area of heterogeneity within the lateral
aspect of the mid pole, probably which demonstrates normal
blood flow and may represent artifact; however, attention to
this area on a follow up scan is recommended to document
interval change or resolution.

On [**2175-6-9**], the patient's right lower extremity was swollen.
The patient complained of right hip and thigh pain, pitting
edema of right lower extremity greater than left lower
extremity so an ultrasound was performed which included the
right iliac artery. This demonstrated acute deep venous
thrombosis within the right common femoral and superficial
femoral veins which had developed since [**2175-6-2**]. There
is a right groin hematoma which was unchanged. The patient
continued to be anticoagulated for DVT.  One drain was
eventually removed, continued on [**2175-6-12**] with drain output of
170, afebrile, vital signs stable.  She went home with
services on the following medications:  Valcyte 450 mg q.
day, Bactrim SS 1 tab q. day, Protonix 40 mg q. day, Nystatin
5 ml suspension, 5 ml four times a day, Colace 100 mg twice a
day, Movlapine 10 mg q. day, Percocet 22 tabs q. day,
Lopressor 100 mg twice a day, MMF 500 mg q.o.d. Coumadin 2 mg
q. day.  This should be monitored to keep the INR between 2
and 3. Reglan 10 mg four times a day before meals and at
bedtime.  Tacrolimus 10 mg p.o. twice a day. Potassium sodium
phosphate, one packet q. day and Compazine 10 mg q. 6 hours
prn.  The patient has a follow up appointment with Dr.
[**Last Name (STitle) **], please call [**Telephone/Fax (1) 673**] for an appointment.  The
patient needs to change dressings on her wound twice a day
located on her groin, place a dry gauze between the wound and
her skin.  No heavy lifting of greater than 10 pounds for the
first 6 weeks after surgery.

DIAGNOSES:  End stage renal disease, status post renal
transplant.
Arterial thrombosis.
Deep venous thrombosis.
Resolving hypertension.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 MRA LEFT ILIAC AND RENAL VESSELS.

 INDICATION:  Patient with query right iliac stenosis status post renal
 transplant.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1- and T2-weighted sequences were acquired.
 Axial T1-weighted in- and out-of-phase imaging, multiplanar HASTE imaging, and
 dynamic contrast-enhanced 3D MRI were performed. Dynamic contrast-enhanced
 imaging was performed before, during, and after the administration of
 intravenous contrast.

 COMPARISON:  No study available for comparison.  Reference made to ultrasound
 [**2175-6-9**].

 MULTIPLANAR REFORMATS:

 The images were exported to an offline workstation for interactive
 interrogation and analysis.  The generated images were invaluable in the
 evaluation of the pathology demonstrated.

 REPORT:
 There is evidence of mild multifocal atheromatous disease within the
 descending abdominal aorta. The native renal arteries are identified and are
 patent, but the native kidneys are small and shrunken, consistent with known
 history of renal impairment. The common iliac arteries are patent bilaterally.

 RIGHT SIDE:
 On the right side, the patient's transplant kidney can be seen in the right
 iliac fossa. The transplant graft renal artery is widely patent.  There is a
 clearly patent anastomosis between the right external iliac artery and the
 graft artery. The external iliac artery is mostly widely patent but 2.7 cm
 below the site of insertion of the graft kidney, there is a short focal area
 of asymmetrical narrowing. The cause of this is uncertain; it may represent an
 eccentric clot or a thrombus formation, but a very short focal dissection
 cannot be excluded. The right external iliac artery is otherwise widely patent
 as is the common femoral artery. The right superficial femoral artery is
 widely patent throughout its length. The right above- and below- knee
 popliteal arteries are also widely patent. Although not specifically
 evaluated, the popliteal artery gives off a patent anterior tibial and
 peroneal artery which appear patent to the level of the ankle.

 LEFT SIDE:  The left common iliac and external iliac arteries are widely
                                                             (Over)

 patent. The left common femoral artery is widely patent throughout its length
 as is the above and below knee popliteal artery.  The below-knee runoff on the
 left side is not specifically evaluated, but a widely patent anterior tibial
 artery is again appreciated.

 Both kidneys are small and shrunken consistant with end stage renal disease.
 The transplant kidney shows good uptake and excretion. In the right groin
 there is 1 6.5 x 2.6 cm fluid collection just medial to the femoral vessels
 that likely represents a seroma. As the patient gives a good history for
 femoral nerve impingement, percutaneous U/S guided drainage could be arranged
 for decompression.

 No other significant abnormality is seen.

 CONCLUSION:

 1) Widely patent arterial system with short focal eccentric narrowing 2.7 cm
 below transplant vascular graft anastomosis - eccentric
 thrombus/atherosclerosis vs. focal dissection
 2) 6.5 x 2.5 cm seroma in region of right femoral nerve

 effacement of the frontal [**Doctor Last Name 39**] of the left lateral ventricle.  The antrum is
 also compressed on the left. The occipital [**Doctor Last Name 39**] is not dilated. There is
 preservation of [**Doctor Last Name 181**]-white matter cortical differentiation.  No skull
 fractures are seen.  There is mucosal thickening in the left maxillary sinus
 and in the ethmoid air cells.

 IMPRESSION:  Large intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the left basal ganglia.
 Distribution is consistent with a hypertensive bleed.

 mass effect on the ventricular system is also unchanged. The osseous
 structures are unremarkable. There is a fluid level in the sphenoid sinus, as
 well as mucosal thickening in the ethmoid sinuses.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATIONS:  OG tube placement.

 PORTABLE AP CHEST:  Comparison is made to previous films from  one day
 earlier.

 Since the previous study, an OG tube has been repositioned in the interval and
 now terminates in the stomach, coiling within the fundus region. An
 endotracheal tube remains in satisfactory position. Cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are upper limits of normal allowing for low lung volumes.  Previously
 reported CHF pattern is no longer evident.  Note is made of decreasing gastric
 distention following repositioning of the NG tube.

 Minimal patchy opacity is noted in the right retrocardiac region.

 IMPRESSION:   Repositioning of nasogastric tube with distal tip within the
 fundus as described above. Interval decrease in the degree of gastric
 distention.

 Multiple axial images were obtained from base to vertex without IV contrast
 administration.  Comparison is made to the prior exam of [**2149-11-11**].

 There is no significant interval change seen involving the hematoma within the
 left basal ganglia, with surrounding cytotoxic edema and slight mass effect
 over the left lateral ventricle. There is minimal shift of the midline
 structures to the right by 5 mm.  No new areas of hemorrhage are seen.  There
 is no intraventricular hemorrhage.  A tiny probable calcific density is seen
 near the midline at the level of the foramen of [**Last Name (un) 565**].  This could represent a
 small benign calcification or a small choloid cyst.  The posterior fossa
 structures were unremarkable. There is significant effacement of the
 nasopharyngeal region by fluid.  The patient is probably intubated.  Mucosal
 thickening is seen within the ethmoid and right maxillary sinuses.

 IMPRESSION:  Stable left-sided hypertensive hemorrhage into the left basal
 ganglia with surrounding mass effect and minimal 5-mm midline shift convex to
 the right.  Further follow up is suggested.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Weakness, inability to talk.

HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 41-year-old
African-American male with a history of hypertension who was
in his usual state of health until about 10:25 a.m. on the
morning of admission.  He had gone to use the restroom and a
few minutes later his family found him slumped onto the
floor, apparently unable to talk and with weakness in his
right arm and leg.  EMS was called and he was brought into
the Emergency Department at [**Hospital1 18**].

The patient has not had strokes or previous similar symptoms.
He has a history of hypertension but no history of cardiac
symptoms.  The patient was unable to talk for examination and
no family members were present at the bedside and were not at
home (apparently they were on the way to the Emergency Room).
The history was obtained by EMS.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Hypertension.

ADMISSION MEDICATIONS:  The patient was on no medications
upon admission.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Unknown.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient lives [**Location (un) 6409**].

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON ADMISSION:  During the five minute
examination, the patient became progressively less responsive
and then vomited requiring intubation and paralytics during
the examination.  Vital signs:  Blood pressure 229/137, heart
rate 85, respiratory rate 20, temperature 98.8.  General:
This was a well-developed African-American male.  HEENT:  The
neck was supple without lymphadenopathy or thyromegaly.
Cardiovascular:  Regular rate and rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs,
or gallops noted.  Lungs:  Clear to auscultation bilaterally.
Abdomen:  Soft, nontender, nondistended with no hepatomegaly.
Extremities:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema noted.
Neurologic:  On the mental status examination, the patient
was alert but nonverbal.  Language was aphasic but can
comprehend one-step commands.  There was no evidence of
neglect.  The patient can follow one-step commands.  On the
cranial nerve examination, his optic disk margins were sharp.
His extraocular eye movements were intact.  His pupils were
equal and reactive to light.  His face was symmetrical at
rest.  Motor:  He had normal bulk and tone with no tremors.
His power was 0/5 in the right arm and leg.  His left arm and
leg was apparently [**5-5**].  Sensory:  He was reactive to noxious
stimuli in all four extremities.  His reflexes were minimal
throughout.  His toes were mute bilaterally.  Coordination
and gait examination was not tested.

LABORATORY/RADIOLOGIC DATA:  White count 7.5, hematocrit 45,
platelets 258,000.  PT 12.7, PTT 21.7, INR 1.1.

The EKG was normal sinus rhythm at 99 with normal axis and
intervals.  LVH was noted.  There were T wave inversions in
I, II, III, aVL, V1 through V3.

Serum and urine toxicology was negative.  ESR was 18.  The
urinalysis was negative.  CT scan of the head showed 55 by 55
by 21 mm left putaminal bleed with a 5 mm midline shift to
the right.

Chest x-ray showed cardiomegaly with CHF.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  1.  NEUROLOGIC:  Left putaminal bleed
secondary to presumed hypertension.  The patient's blood
pressure was initially controlled with a Nipride drip to keep
the cephalic pressure between 130-160.  The Nipride drip was
then weaned as labetalol IV was added along with a
nicardipine drip.  The patient was also given Dilantin load
followed by a maintenance dose of 400 mg q.d.  His level has
been therapeutic around 20.  Considerations for a CTA and
angiogram for possible AVM or aneurysm were considered but
the patient's renal function and health status did not allow
such studies to be done at the current time.

Repeated noncontrast CT of the head revealed no increase in
the bleeding but showed subsequently increases in cerebral
edema with some pressure onto the brain stem.  The patient's
neurological examination did deteriorate to the point that he
only had reactive pupils that were equal and intact corneal
reflexes.  In addition, he had a gag reflex.  However, he
began to not move any extremities and not respond to any
noxious stimuli in the four extremities.

By 4:00 p.m. on [**2149-11-13**], his neurological condition
deteriorated to the point that his pupils were dilated and
nonreactive.  He lost gag and corneal reflex.  Calorics were
done at this time which revealed no response.  Neurosurgery
was reconsulted for a question of craniotomy but they felt
that the patient would not be a candidate for the surgery in
that it would not help him.  Mannitol was then started along
with hyperventilation to keep the PC02 below 30 in an attempt
to decrease the cerebral edema.

Despite clinical examination that the patient is clinically
brain dead, the family wishes to continue aggressive
treatment.  The family requested that the patient be
transferred to the [**Hospital6 1129**].  However,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 54029**] at the [**Hospital3 **] Stroke Service said
that the patient would not be accepted at the [**Hospital3 **] given that there would be no other intervention that
would be done differently at [**Hospital3 **].

2.  CARDIOVASCULAR:  As mentioned above, the patient was
initially started on a Nipride drip to control the blood
pressure between 130-160.  However, he was slowly weaned off
the Nipride to be switched over to Cardene drip.  The Cardene
drip was then weaned to allow for the addition of p.o.
Labetalol.  Three serial CKs and troponins were checked and
found to be negative, thus, ruling the patient out for a
myocardial infarction.

3.  PULMONARY:  The patient was initially intubated when
first seen down in the Emergency Room for airway protection
since he vomited.  He then showed a left lower lobe pneumonia
on the chest x-ray.  He was started on levofloxacin and
Flagyl since the day of admission for aspiration pneumonia.
Vancomycin was added on day number four of hospitalization
due to sputum cultures showing Staphylococcus aureus
coagulase-positive organisms and gram-negative rods.
Susceptibilities are still pending.  The patient did have one
or two episodes of desaturation secondary to breathing trials
and increased secretion in his nostrils.  In an attempt to
decongest him, saline nasal spray was started.

4.  RENAL:  Acute renal failure secondary to dehydration.
The patient's creatinine upon admission was 1.4 and continued
to rise to 2 as he started third spacing his fluids.  Urine
electrolytes were checked which showed a phena of less than 1
which is evidence of the patient being dehydrated and
prerenal.  He was subsequently given IV fluids and his
creatinine improved to 1.6.  A renal ultrasound was done
which showed no evidence of hydronephrosis.

5.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE:  Leukocytosis:  Given the aspiration
pneumonia and elevated white count of 18.6, levofloxacin and
Flagyl were started on the day of admission.  Blood cultures
were obtained.  The first two sets showed one out of four
blood cultures that grew staphylococcus coagulase-negative.
Since this was deemed a contaminent, no further antibiotics
were given.  However, on day number four of hospitalization,
his sputum culture returned showing Staphylococcus
coagulase-positive organisms so vancomycin was added.  More
blood cultures were drawn but nothing has grown to date.

6.  GASTROINTESTINAL:  The patient was given and orogastric
tube for tube feeds.  He had some high residuals so the tube
feeds were stopped.  Reglan was then administered to promote
GI motility so that the tube feeds could be restarted.

7. FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES, AND NUTRITION:  Hyponatremia:  The
patient's sodium slowly fell from 136 upon admission to 130
on the fourth day of hospitalization.  It was felt that this
was due to salt wasting from his cerebral problems so he was
then fluid restricted.  Although he has acute renal failure
secondary to dehydration and third spacing, it was felt that
he needed to be fluid restricted given that the overall
hyponatremia was more likely due to salt wasting.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION: Cerebral hemorrhage with acute low blood pressure.

 COMPARISON: [**2149-11-12**].

 TECHNIQUE: Noncontrast head CT.

 FINDINGS: Again noted is a large area of hemorrhage within the left basal
 ganglia with a moderate but stable amount of mass effect and approximately 5
 mm of stable shift of midline structures toward the right. The degree of
 cerebral edema has increased in the interval, with interval effacement of
 sulci bilaterally. Additionally, the suprasellar cisterns and ambient cisterns
 are less apparent than on the prior study. [**Doctor Last Name **]/white differentiation is
 slightly decreased since the prior study, although they can still be
 distinguished. Again noted is moderate mucosal thickening within the
 maxillary, sphenoid, and ethmoid sinuses bilaterally. There is mild mucosal
 thickening within the frontal sinuses bilaterally.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. Stable size of left basal ganglia hypertensive hemorrhage.
 2. Global increase in brain edema, raising the question of diffuse anoxic
 injury.

 Findings discussed by telephone with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 11229**] in the afternoon of

Service:

Despite mannital and hyperventilation on the [**2149-11-13**], patient continued to neurologically decline.  A brain
death exam was done showing that the patient had dilated
unreactive pupils with no evidence of a corneal or gag
reflex. He also did not respond to any noxious stimuli
despite being off propofol.

An apnea test was performed allowing the pCO2 to rise above
60, and the patient still did not take any breath during the
10 minute interval.  At this time he was declared brain
death.  His family requested no organ donor or autopsy be
done.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 EMERGENCY MRI SCAN OF THE BRAIN.

 HISTORY:  Ring-enhancing brain mass with edema seen on CT scan.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1 and T2-weighted brain images with gadolinium
 enhancement.

 COMPARISON STUDIES:  None available at this time.

 WET READ REPORT:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2119**] interpreted this study as revealing
 ""bilateral parenchymal masses, suggesting metastatic disease.  The largest
 mass in the right parietal lobe has a complex appearance, at least 5 cm in
 greatest dimension with at least 8 cm greatest dimension of surrounding edema
 and 7 mm leftward midline shift.""  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2119**] is a member of the
 ""Nighthawk"" Radiology group.

 FINDINGS:  The study indeed reveals a large right parietal, irregularly thick
 ring enhancing mass, possibly with some tiny ""daughter"" cystic components
 extending towards the cortical surface.  As mentioned in the wet [**Location (un) 245**],
 there is a substantial area of surrounding edema, with effacement of the right
 atrium and approximately 7 mm leftward subfalcine herniation.  A smaller area
 of edema is seen within the white matter of the left occipital lobe, but I
 cannot delineate any specific area of enhancement associated with it.  A
 third, very well circumscribed 18 x 26 mm area of elevated T2 signal is seen
 contiguous to the left temporal lobe, and it is difficult to determine whether
 the lesion is intra- or extra-axial in locale.  Again, there is no associated
 enhancement and no abnormal susceptibility is noted, either.  On the coronal
 post-contrast images, there is a questionable area of enhancement,
 approximately 3 mm, immediately subjacent to the left temporal lesion- I am
 not certain that the two findings are necessarily related.  The principal
 vascular flow patterns are identified.  There is no overt extracranial
 abnormality noted.

 CONCLUSION:  Large right parietal lobe mass, which may represent either a
 primary or metastatic brain neoplasm.  The additional abnormalities within the
                                                             (Over)

                                 FINAL REPORT
 (Cont)
 left temporal lobe and left occipital lobe, while they may represent extremely
 unusual manifestations of metastatic disease, which would then render the
 right parietal lobe lesion more likely metastatic, could have alternative
 diagnoses, including hemorrhage or a calcified left temporal meningioma as an
 explanation for the left temporal lesion, and either an inflammatory or
 ischemic process to account for the left occipital lesion.  I discussed this
 case this morning with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], it was decided that a non-contrast head CT
 scan would be a helpful followup diagnostic procedure to further characterize
 the left cerebral hemispheric lesions prior to brain biopsy of the right
 parietal lesion.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No acute cardiopulmonary disease.
 2.  No evidence of a primary pulmonary neoplasm, but PA/Lateral CXR or CT
 would be more sensitive than a portable study and may be helpful for more
 complete assessment, if not already recently obtained.

 INDICATION:  50-year-old woman with new bilateral masses.

 COMPARISON:  MRI dated [**2178-4-16**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Head CT without and with IV contrast.

 CT HEAD WITHOUT AND WITH IV CONTRAST:  There is a large right parietal lesion
 with ring enhancement and associated large vasogenic edema. Effacement of the
 sulci and right to left midline shift is again noted, and unchanged when
 compared to the prior MRI study. No evidence of calcifications.

 The left temporal lobe lesion previously described on MRI appears hyperdense
 on CT and demonstrates no evidence of enhancement after intravenous contrast
 administration.  No calcifications are noted within this lesion.

 The small left  occipital lesion described on recent MR, is hypodense on CT
 and show no evidence of enhancement. No new lesions are identified.

 IMPRESSION:
 1. Large right parietal intravenous contrast enhancing lesion with associated
 large vasogenic edema. Hyperdense non-enhancing left temporal lobe lesion, not
 typical for hematoma on a recent MRI.
 Differential diagnosis for these lesions include multifocal glioma and
 multiple metastasis. Less likely demyelinating disease.

 STEREOTACTIC CT SCAN

 HISTORY:  Stereotactic biopsy.

 TECHNIQUE:  Intravenously enhanced stereotactic brain imaging was obtained
 with the overlying frame creating some artifacts through several scans.
 Also, the extreme caudal posterior fossa was not included on the present image
 series.

 FINDINGS:  The large right parietal, irregularly ring enhancing mass is again
 seen with the same degree of compression of the right atrium and contralateral
 subfalcine herniation that was observed on the prior day's studies.  The left
 occipital and left temporal lobe lesions, also described, are not any more
 conspicuous on today's study.  The lack of enhancement of the left temporal
 lobe lesion raises the probability that it is an evolving hemorrhage.  No
 other new lesions are seen, within the technical limitations of this study.

 CONCLUSION:  Stereotactic planning scan, as noted above.

 CT HEAD WITHOUT CONTRAST

 INDICATION:  50-year-old woman status post stereotactic brain biopsy.  Rule
 out postop intracranial hemorrhage.

 COMPARISON:  Head CT dated [**2178-4-17**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Head CT without contrast.

 FINDINGS:  Again seen the large right parietal mass, status post biopsy with
 pneumocephalus.  The degree of compression of the right lateral ventricle
 and surrounding edema are unchanged compared to the previous examination.  The
 shift of normally midline structures is not appreciably changed, measuring
 about 5 mm, compared to 4 mm previously. Hyperdense left temporal lesion is
 unchanged.

 IMPRESSION:  Unchanged mass effect and edema around large right parietal mass,
 without evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage following biopsy.

 Findings were discussed with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) 331**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 16488**] at 1:30 a.m. on [**2178-4-17**].

 NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN

 HISTORY:  Brain mass.  Now has headache.  Evaluate for any changes.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2178-4-17**] CT scan of the head, reported by Drs.
 [**Last Name (STitle) 539**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 5493**] as revealing ""unchanged mass effect and edema around
 large right parietal mass, without evidence of new intracranial hemorrhage
 following biopsy.""

 FINDINGS:  Since the prior study, there is now mild linear hyperdensity within
 the basal cisterns that could be subarachnoid hemorrhage, although
 occasionally the tributaries of the circle of [**Location (un) 505**] can be somewhat denser
 appearing, in the setting of increased intracranial pressure, a finding which
 would mimic the presence of subarachnoid blood.

 No other new intracranial or extracranial abnormalities are discerned.

 CONCLUSION:  Possible small amount of subarachnoid blood or relatively
 stagnant vascular flow, in the face of increased intracranial pressure, as
 noted above.  We spoke with you immediately after the conclusion of the
 study regarding these findings.

 ADDENDUM:  There is a tiny residual gas collection superior to the biopsy
 site, definitely decreased in extent compared to the prior study of [**4-17**].

 RADIOPHARMECEUTICAL DATA:
    27.5 mCi Tc-[**Age over 90 **]m MDP ([**2178-4-21**]);
 HISTORY: 50 year old woman with new brain lesion presenting for assessment of
 possible osseous metastases.

 INTERPRETATION:

 Whole body images of the skeleton were obtained in anterior and posterior
 projections.  There is no focal tracer abnormality to suggest osseous
 metastases.  Urinary retention of a large amount of tracer despite attempts at
 voiding limit the evaluation of the pelvis.

 The kidneys and urinary bladder are visualized, the normal route of tracer
 excretion.

 IMPRESSION: No scintigraphic evidence of osseous metastases. Evaluation of
 pelvis compromised by large amount of urinary tracer retention.

 Compared to [**2178-4-16**].

 FINDINGS:  There has been interval biopsy of the large ring enhancing right
 parietal lesion, yielding the diagnosis of GBM.  Overall, the lesion has not
 changed significantly in one week interim.  Also unchanged are an
 approximately 2.5 cm likely intra-axial left temporal lobe lesion, with a 1 cm
 enhancing nodule in its inferior aspect, as well as an area of edema in the
 left occipital lobe, without a discrete enhancing component.  7 mm leftward
 shift of midline structures and the overall mass effect produced by the
 lesions has not changed appreciably.

 IMPRESSION:  3 stable lesions, right parietal one diagnosed as GBM, left
 temporal one with an enhancing nodular component, and left occipital one
 without visible enhancement.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  CT scan of the previous day.

 FINDINGS:  The present examination is degraded by motion artifacts.  Allowing
 for this limitation, there has been slight interval expansion in size of the
 right parietal cavitary lesion.  The extent of surrounding edema and the
 remaining additional lesions, as well as mass effect, are unaltered in extent.
 The other abnormalities described in the previous day's report as well remain
 stable.  No other new extracranial abnormalities are discerned.

 CONCLUSION:  Findings suggest slight interval increase in the size of the
 right parietal cavitary lesion.  We telephoned you with this observation
 immediately after the performance of the study.

 NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT SCAN

 HISTORY:  Status post second brain surgical procedure, which Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 686**]
 indicated included craniotomy and tumor debulking. Rule out postoperative
 intracranial hemorrhage.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT scan.

 COMPARISON STUDY:  [**2178-4-22**], examination reported by me as revealing
 ""slight interval increase in the size of the right parietal cavitary lesion.""

 FINDINGS:  Since the prior study, surgical staples are now present, as well as
 interval performance of a right parietal craniotomy.  Within the soft tissues
 spanning this defect is gas, presumably postoperative in nature.  The cavitary
 lesion now contains some gas and along its superior aspect, and an
 approximately 1-cm hyperdense area, the latter likely representing hemorrhage.
 This constellation of findings, as well as a rather dramatic reduction in size
 of the cavity, presumably reflects interval partial removal of the tumor or at
 least cavitary contents.  The degree of subfalcine herniation is essentially
 unchanged in degree, as is the overall size and configuration of the
 supratentorial ventricular system.  There is no other interval change
 appreciated.

 CONCLUSION:  Post-surgical changes, as noted above.
 Findings were relayed and discussed with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 686**] today, by telephone.

History of Present Illness:
HPI: 50 year old female presents after having fallen in the
bathtub 4 days ago and hitting the back of her head. Since then
she has had a ""massive headache"" which did not resolve with
Tylenol. She states that she has a high threshold for pain and
did not realize how bad it was during the day while at work but
then when she got home at night she noticed it. The patient
noticed ""silvery spects"" in her vision and she had trouble with
some simple tasks like finding the tags on the back of her
clothing in the morning. She reported that she had to check
several times to make sure she did not put her clothes on
backwards. She has had some dizziness, but no nausea or
vomiting.
Her speech has not been affected.

""Nighthawk"" Radiology group.

FINDINGS: The study indeed reveals a large right parietal,
irregularly thick ring enhancing mass, possibly with some tiny
""daughter"" cystic components extending towards the cortical
surface. As mentioned in the wet [**Location (un) 1131**], there is a substantial
area of surrounding edema, with effacement of the right atrium
and approximately 7 mm leftward subfalcine herniation. A smaller
area of edema is seen within the white matter of the left
occipital lobe, but I cannot delineate any specific area of
enhancement associated with it. A third, very well circumscribed
18 x 26 mm area of elevated T2 signal is seen contiguous to the
left temporal lobe, and it is difficult to determine whether the
lesion is intra- or extra-axial in locale. Again, there is no
associated enhancement and no abnormal susceptibility is noted,
either. On the coronal post-contrast images, there is a
questionable area of enhancement, approximately 3 mm,
immediately subjacent to the left temporal lesion- I am not
certain that the two findings are necessarily related. The
principal vascular flow patterns are identified. There is no
overt extracranial abnormality noted.

CONCLUSION: Large right parietal lobe mass, which may represent
either a primary or metastatic brain neoplasm. The additional
abnormalities within the left temporal lobe and left occipital
lobe, while they may represent extremely unusual manifestations
of metastatic disease, which would then render the right
parietal lobe lesion more likely metastatic, could have
alternative diagnoses, including hemorrhage or a calcified left
temporal meningioma as an explanation for the left temporal
lesion, and either an inflammatory or ischemic process to
account for the left occipital lesion. I discussed this case
this morning with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], it was decided that a non-contrast
head CT scan would be a helpful followup diagnostic procedure to
further characterize the left cerebral hemispheric lesions prior
to brain biopsy of the right parietal lesion.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
50 year old woman with bilateral masses
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
please evaluate preop
INDICATION: Bilateral brain masses for pre-op evaluation.

PORTABLE CHEST: There are no priors for comparison. Heart size
is normal. Mediastinal and hilar contours are normal. Pulmonary
vasculature is normal. Lungs are clear, and there are no
effusions or pneumothorax.

IMPRESSION:
1. No acute cardiopulmonary disease.
2. No evidence of a primary pulmonary neoplasm, but PA/Lateral
CXR or CT would be more sensitive than a portable study and may
be helpful for more complete assessment, if not already recently
obtained.

The study and the report were reviewed by the staff radiologist.

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 50 year-old woman without significant PMH who presented
[**2178-4-16**] from OSH with new dx of brain mass after fall, with
biopsy that showed GBM, for which she had craniectomy/debulking
[**2178-4-23**] and was started on XRT without event.
.
1) Glioblastoma Multiforme: She was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] after
fall and was noted to have a brain mass. She had a biopsy which
showed glioblastoma, WHO grade IV. She was noted on [**4-21**] to have
headache, with 4/18 she had mental status changes and imaging
c/w herniation. She was taken emergently to the OR [**4-23**] for
craniotomy and subtotal tumor debulking. She was then
transferred to Omed for XRT and chemotherapy. She was maintained
on keppra and decadron for seizure/cerebral edema prevention.
She was maintained on seizure precautions with frequent neuro
checks. She used a helmet with ambulation given s/p craniectomy.
She was started on XRT with temador. She remained stable without
signs of elevated intracranial pressure during this so was
thought stable to go home and continue XRT as an outpatient. She
was seen by PT and though stable to go home. She was continued
on pantoprazole and sliding scale insulin while on
dexamethasone.

 MR OF THE HEAD

 INDICATION:  50-year-old female with GBM, rule out progression or new lesions.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1, T2, and T1 post-gadolinium images of the brain
 were obtained.

 Comparison is made to the prior MRI performed on [**2178-4-22**].

 FINDINGS:  Since the prior MRI, there has been a right frontoparietal
 craniectomy with herniation of the brain tissue through the craniectomy
 defect.  There has been partial resection of the previously noted ring
 enhancing lesion.  There is now hemorrhage within the surgical tract within
 the temporal lobe.  In addition, there is still residual enhancement extending
 from the surface of the parietal lobe inferiorly and medially to reach the
 splenium of the corpus callosum as well as the ependymal surface of the right
 lateral ventricle.  There is apparent enhancement of the ependymal surface,
 suggestive of subependymal spread of tumor.  There still remains mass effect
 upon the right lateral ventricle, relatively unchanged.

 Also since the prior MRI, there is a new burr hole in the left parietal bone.
 The left temporal lesion is again noted and now demonstrates increased
 interval enhancement as compared to the prior study.  In addition, there is a
 T2 hyperintense lesion within the left occipital lobe which does not
 demonstrate post-gadolinium enhancement and primarily involves the white
 matter but does extend to the cortical surface in some portions.  No new
 lesions are identified.  There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or
 hydrocephalus.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Postoperative changes in the right frontoparietal region with partial
 resection of the ring enhancing lesion.  There is now postoperative hemorrhage
 with some residual enhancement extending along the surgical bed to involve the
 splenium of the corpus callosum as well as the ependymal surface of the right
 lateral ventricle.
 2.  Increased enhancement of left temporal lobe lesion.
 3.  T2 hyperintense lesion in the left occipital lobe without post-gadolinium
 enhancement, unchanged.

 EXAM:  MRI of the brain.

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with GBM and weakness and falls, rule out
 progression of disease.

 TECHNIQUE:  T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR, T2, susceptibility and diffusion
 axial images were obtained before gadolinium.  T1 sagittal, axial, and coronal
 images were obtained following the administration of gadolinium.  Comparison
 was made with the previous MRI examination of [**2178-5-18**].

 FINDINGS:  The previously noted left posterior temporal lobe lesion now
 demonstrates new area of late subacute hemorrhage, increase in size and
 enhancement.  There is also increased surrounding edema identified with mild
 mass effect on the left lateral ventricle.

 Again seen is right parietal craniotomy defect with slight protrusion of the
 brain substance through the defect.  There is edema seen in the right parietal
 lobe extending to the posterior portion of the corpus callosum.  There is rim
 enhancing lesion identified in this region which is now better appreciated
 following resolution of blood product seen on the immediate post-operative
 prior study.  Overall the enhancement in the lesion may have slightly
 increased in size with probable slight increase in edema.

 Again a non- enhancing left occipital region with T2 hyperintensities
 identified. There is no hydrocephalus seen.  No significant midline shift is
 identified.

 IMPRESSION:  1. Increase in size with evidence of interval hemorrhage and
 increase in edema in the previously noted left temporal lobe lesion with mild
 mass effect on the left lateral ventricle.

 2. Slight increase in size of rim- enhancing lesion at the right parietal lobe
 extending to the region of brain slightly protruding through the craniotomy
 defect due to edema.  There is also slight increase in surrounding edema seen
 in this region.

 3. No change in non-enhancing left occipital T2/FLAIr abnormality.

 bleed.

 Comparison made to prior head CT dated [**2178-4-30**] and prior MRI dated [**7-30**], [**2178**].

 NON-CONTRAST HEAD CT 	

 FINDINGS:  There has been no significant interval change in the surrounding
 edema and mass effect relating to the dominant right frontoparietal lesion and
 a left temporal lesion (measuring approximately 2.8 x 3.2 cm), both displaying
 small areas of linear hyperdensity surrounding them likely related to
 hemorrhage as noted on recent MRI.  Protrusion of the brain parenchyma outside
 of the right craniotomy site does not appear significantly changed from prior
 MRI examination.  No significant subfalcine herniation, hydrocephalus, or new
 areas of hemorrhage are identified.  The surrounding soft tissues and osseous
 structures appear unremarkable.  Paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are
 well aerated.

 IMPRESSION:  Interval worsening of intracranial lesions when compared to [**Month (only) 2413**]
 CT examination, but with no overt change when compared to [**7-30**] MRI
 examination in amount of hemorrhage and surrounding edema.  No new areas of
 focal hemorrhage are identified.

Date of Birth:   [**2032-3-24**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known firstname **] [**Known lastname 363**] is a
72-year-old male with a past medical history significant for
pancreatic cancer, ulcerative colitis, hypertension, status
post endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, and
status post total abdominal colectomy 20 years ago with an
end-ileostomy.

The patient underwent an endoscopic retrograde
cholangiopancreatography recently, but a stent was unable to
be placed.  A computed tomography was performed which
demonstrated a head of the pancreas mass with dilated
intrahepatic duct along with vascular involvement of the
gastroduodenal artery and superior mesenteric vein.  He
presented for exploratory laparotomy with possible pancreatic
mass resection.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Ulcerative colitis.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Benign prostatic hypertrophy.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:
1.  Total abdominal colectomy with end-ileostomy.
2.  Status post transurethral resection of prostate.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
1.  Moexipril 15 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Aspirin 81 mg by mouth once per day.
3.  Atenolol 25 mg by mouth once per day.
4.  Allopurinol 300 mg by mouth once per day.
5.  Multivitamin.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  The patient is a thin,
cachectic Caucasian male who was alert and oriented times
three.  In no apparent distress.  The sclerae were anicteric.
The patient was jaundiced.  The oropharynx was clear with
moist mucous membranes.  The neck was supple and without
lymphadenopathy.  The heart was regular in rate and rhythm.
The lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The
abdomen was soft, nontender, and nondistended.  There was a
well-healed midline scar and ileostomy present.  The
extremities were warm without cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  His hematocrit
was 43.2.  His INR was 1.2.  Creatinine was 1.6.  Aspartate
aminotransferase was 51, his alanine-aminotransferase was 89,
his alkaline phosphatase was 395, and his total bilirubin was
12.5.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  On the day of admission,
the patient was taken to the operating room where an
exploratory laparotomy was performed.  The patient had
evidence of unresectable pancreatic cancer with biliary
obstruction seen intraoperatively.  Adhesiolysis was
therefore performed along with a Roux-en-Y
hepaticojejunostomy, and open cholecystectomy, an open
pancreatic biopsy, and a gastrojejunostomy.  The estimated
blood loss for the procedure was 250 cc.

The patient was discharged to the regular hospital floor
after being extubated in the Postanesthesia Care Unit in good
condition.

In the evening on postoperative day one, the patient was
taken back to the operating room emergently for likely
mesenteric bleeding.  This was controlled with suture
ligation, and the patient was admitted to the Surgical
Intensive Care Unit postoperatively for close monitoring.
The patient remained intubated in the Intensive Care Unit on
pressor support and received total parenteral nutrition until
postoperative day seven.  At this time, the patient's mental
status was extremely labile requiring Haldol for agitation.
The patient's hematocrit was stable at 35.8 at this time.

Tube feeds were initiated on postoperative day eight.  On
postoperative day nine, the patient was transferred to the
regular hospital floor.  At this time, tube feeds were held
for elevated residuals and nausea.  He was still receiving
total parenteral nutrition at this time.  The patient's
mental status was still not completely improved.  A computed
tomography scan was performed on postoperative day ten which
did not demonstrate any intra-abdominal pathology.

The patient was started on sips on postoperative day eleven
and was started on his home medications.  At this time, he
was seen by the Physical Therapy Service and was being
screened for rehabilitation placement.

However, on the evening on postoperative day twelve the
patient spiked a temperature to 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit.  A
fever workup was done including a chest x-ray and blood
cultures.

Early the next morning, the patient was found unresponsive
without a pulse at approximately 2:45 a.m.  At this time, a
code blue was called and advanced cardiac life support
protocol was initiated.  However, the patient was asystolic
without any respiratory effort at this time.  He did receive
multiple rounds of epinephrine along with attempts at
ventilation.  However, the patient never regained electrical
activity and was pronounced deceased at 2:57 a.m.  The
patient's wife was notified at this time.  However, a
postmortem examination was declined.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient expired on [**2105-8-21**].

Date of Birth:   [**2127-2-27**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Cardiac surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chest pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 39-year-old woman with
diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia and obesity, with a
one to two months of chest burning with exertion. For the
past six months, she has been participating in a new vigorous
exercise program to lose weight. Her symptoms do gradually
resolve with rest, but they have started to occur now with
walking. She does acknowledge that there is associated
nausea, diaphoresis and shortness of breath. Now recently she
started to get symptoms for the past two days while at rest.
She was referred for an outpatient exercise tolerance test,
where she had chest pain and significant EKG changes. She was
referred to [**Hospital1 18**] for cardiac catheterization today, which
revealed significant left main artery disease. Just prior to
her transfer to [**Hospital1 18**], she did complain of chest pain and
back pain at about 7/10 intensity and a nitroglycerin drip
was started and she received 5 mg of IV Lopressor and 2 mg of
IV Ativan, which did resolve her pain. While she was in the
cath lab, she had an intraaortic balloon pump placed, and now
she is not actively complaining of any pain.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  She denies any orthopnea, lower extremity
edema, but she does acknowledge that she does have
dysmenorrhea.

PRIOR MEDICAL HISTORY:  She has diabetes mellitus, type 2,
diagnosed in [**2157**]. She has been able to control it with diet
since [**2166-6-22**]; hypertension and obesity; however, she has
lost 40 pounds in the last six months.

SHE HAS AN ALLERGY TO SHELLFISH.

MEDICATIONS ON TRANSFERS TO [**Hospital1 18**]:  Atenolol 50 mg a day,
lisinopril 10 mg a day, Lipitor 20 mg a day, aspirin 325 mg
once a day, progesterone, nitroglycerin drip, Lopressor,
Ativan.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke. She does not use ethanol
and she does not use cocaine. Her father had a brain tumor.
Her brother did have coronary artery disease and a myocardial
infarction in his late 30s. Her mother has hypertension. She
does have a strong family history for hyperlipidemia.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is comfortable appearing,
in no apparent distress. Vital signs: Temperature 99.1, pulse
72, blood pressure 144/87. Pulse oximetry is 98% on room air.
Head and neck: PERRLA. EOMI. Anicteric. Mucous membranes
moist. Neck supple, no lymphadenopathy, no JVD. Cardiac:
Regular rate and rhythm. Lungs clear to auscultation
bilaterally. Abdomen is soft, nontender, nondistended, but
she is morbidly obese, positive bowel sounds. Her extremities
are warm, no edema. She has got 5/5 strength in all
extremities.

Her laboratories prior to admission from [**Hospital3 1280**] were
white count 7.4, hematocrit of 39.8, platelets 190,000.
Hemoglobin A1c was 7.1. Sodium was 140, potassium 4.1,
chloride 103, bicarbonate 28, BUN 14, creatinine 0.6. Total
cholesterol was 307, triglycerides were 79, and HDL was 50.

[**Last Name (STitle) 54218**], which was at [**Hospital3 1280**] (it was not at
[**Hospital1 18**]), showed diffuse left main and proximal left anterior
descending artery stenosis, 60% to 70%, which was ulcerative;
50% mid LAD stenosis; 50% left circumflex stenosis after OM1;
moderate right coronary artery stenosis; a normal ejection
fraction of 78%; no mitral regurgitation. Note that the right
coronary artery stenosis that I am reported is different than
what was actually reported on the initial catheterization
results from [**Hospital3 1280**]. This was discussed between Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) 411**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**], and was not actually considered to be
80% as previously reported.

So this was a woman who was considered to have unstable
angina but not actively ischemic. She was put on an
intraaortic balloon pump, followed in the cardiac care unit,
and was ""preoped"" and consented for a CABG on the next day
because of her three-vessel disease. She was made n.p.o.
after midnight and then in the morning she was taken to the
operating room.

On[**Last Name (STitle) 19203**] of [**2167-1-9**], Ms. [**Known lastname 42915**] went to the
operating room with Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for bypass surgery.
Please refer to the previously dictated operative note by Dr.
[**Last Name (Prefixes) **] for the specifics of this surgery. In brief,
three grafts were made. One was a left internal mammary to
the left anterior descending artery and then two saphenous
vein grafts were connected to the OM1 and OM2. She was on
cardiopulmonary bypass for 76 minutes and the aorta was cross
clamped for 53 of those minutes.

She tolerated the surgery well and was transferred to the
intensive care unit on propofol and Neo-Synephrine drips.

Postoperatively, Ms. [**Known lastname 42915**] did extremely well. Her
intraaortic balloon pump and all of her intravenous drips
were discontinued on postoperative day one. On postoperative
day two she was extubated and on postoperative day three she
was transferred to the floor. Ms. [**Known lastname 54219**] major floor issues
were as follows.

Ms. [**Known lastname 42915**] was followed by physical therapy, which cleared
her to go home with home physical therapy to assist with
mobility, strength and endurance. She was also actively
diuresed with Lasix and had her potassium repleted
accordingly. Finally, she was noted to have hyperglycemia
while she resumed her regular diet. [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) 8392**] consultation
was obtained and they recommended metformin 500 mg twice a
day to maintain euglycemia. She would follow her sugar as an
outpatient and report this back in an outpatient followup
appointment.

On [**1-14**] the patient's central line was discontinued.
She was scheduled to leave, but she developed chest pain;
however, this chest pain was considered not to be cardiac, to
be more gastrointestinal in nature, and she had ......... and
an EKG, both of which confirmed a noncardiac source for this
chest pain.

She is, therefore, on [**1-15**], postoperative day six,
being discharged home in good condition with home physical
therapy scheduled.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:
1.  Type 2 diabetes mellitus.
2.  Hypertension.
3.  Obesity.
4.  Hyperlipidemia.
5.  Unstable angina.
6.  Three-vessel coronary artery disease, status post
coronary artery bypass grafting, status post intraaortic
balloon pump.
7.  Hypokalemia.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1.  Metoprolol 100 mg t.i.d.
2.  Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
3.  Captopril 50 mg p.o. t.i.d.
4.  Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
5.  Lasix 20 mg p.o. b.i.d. for one week.
6.  Potassium chloride 10 mEq p.o. b.i.d. for one week.
7.  Metformin 500 mg p.o. b.i.d.;  follow your blood sugar
levels and follow up with [**Doctor First Name 8392**].
8.  Percocet one to two tablets every four hours as needed
for pain.
9.  Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. as needed for constipation.

[**Last Name (STitle) 54220**]owup appointments are with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **], her primary
care physician, [**Name10 (NameIs) **] one to two weeks, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 911**], her
cardiologist, in two to three weeks, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] from [**Doctor First Name 8392**]
as directed, and Dr. [**Last Name (Prefixes) **] in one month. She is also
recommended to follow up in [**Hospital1 18**] Wound Care Clinic in one to
two weeks to remove her staples.

can certainly be addressed percutaneously with balloon
angiography. She will be followed very closely by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 677**]
as an outpatient, and if this lesion does cause her problems,
this may be addressed.

 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Repeat dictation for previiously lost report.

 Comparison made to previous frontal chest radiograph from the same date.

 A single lateral chest radiograph is submitted for interpretation for
 assessment of chest tube.

 A left-sided chest tube is present, coursing posteriorly at the level of the
 side port.  Correlation with frontal radiograph of earlier the same date shows
 that the side port is external to the chest wall.  If there has been
 repositioning of the tube since the prior chest radiograph of the same date,
 an additional frontal view would be recommended to allow more complete
 assessment of its location.  There remains evidence of left lower lobe
 consolidation and bilateral pleural effusions.

 INDICATION: Left pleural effusion s/p CABG.  Evaluate the persistent effusion
 after left chest tube placement.

 TECHNIQUE: Contiguous axial images were obtained through the chest without IV
 contrast.  No IV contrast was used secondary to patient allergies.

 CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: The patient is s/p median sternotomy.  There is
 moderate cardiac enlargement. Air is present within the pericardium and there
 is soft tissue attenuation within the anterior mediastinum. These findings are
 consistent with recent CABG. There is a moderate left pleural effusion.  A
 left sided chest tube is present which terminates within the pleural space.
 There is also a small loculated pneumothorax on the left, anteriorly. The left
 hemidiaphragm is elevated and there is collapse of the left lower lobe.  Also
 noted is a small-moderate right pleural effusion with the presence of right
 basilar atelectasis. The airways are patent to the level of the segmental
 bronchi.

 Limited evaluation of the upper abdomen reveals no abnormalities.

 Bone windows demonstrate no suspicious lytic or sclerotic abnormalities.

 IMPRESSION:

 1) Moderate left pleural effusion. The left sided chest tube appears to be in
 the pleural space. Also noted is loculated left sided pneumothorax anteriorly.

 2) Findings consistent with recent CABG.

 3) Small-moderate right pleural effusion.

 4) Bibasilar atelectasis, greater on the left than on the right. There is
 elevation of the left hemidiaphragm.

 INDICATION: 39 year old woman who is status post CABG and VATS for empyema.
 History of scleroderma. IV tried at bedside to place PICC and failed.
 Requiring long-term IV antibiotics.

 RADIOLOGISTS PERFORMING PROCEDURE: Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 2844**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **]; Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 873**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 874**]; Dr.
 [**First Name (STitle) 1121**] [**Name (STitle) **] [**Doctor Last Name 1122**], the staff radiologist, was present throughout the
 entire procedure.

 PROCEDURE/TECHNIQUE: The patient was placed supine on the angiography table
 with the left arm prepped and draped in the usual sterile fashion. Through an
 anesthetized skin approach and utilizing ultrasound guidance attempts were
 made at accessing both brachial veins. This was unsuccessful. The veins were
 extremely small and the overlying skin was very thick and tough. A third
 suitable vein was found to be the cephalic vein very proximally near the
 antecubital fossa. Again through an anesthetized skin approach and utilizing a
 micropuncture set access was obtained to the cephalic vein. A Nitinol tipped
 wire was then advanced into the axillary vein. The puncture needle was then
 exchanged for the inner and outer dilator of the micropuncture set. The
 Nitinol wire was then exchanged for an 0.018 angled Glidewire. Contrast was
 injected through the inner dilator prior to the exchange to determine optimal
 course for the Glidewire. The wire was then placed. This was placed in the
 distal superior vena cava. The single lumen Vaxcel catheter was then advanced
 after removing the inner dilator into the distal superior vena cava. The
 catheter was then removed and then appropriately sized to 50 cm. The catheter
 was then readvanced over the 0.018 angled Glidewire into the superior vena
 cava. The wire was removed. The peel-away sheath was removed. The catheter was
 secured to the skin using an OpSite and a Stat-Lock. Good bidirectional flow
 was seen. Post procedure x-ray demonstrated the tip to be located at the
 superior vena caval/right atrial junction.

 CONTRAST/MEDICATIONS: 5 cc of nonionic contrast IV. 10 cc of 1% Lidocaine SQ
 for local anesthetic.

 COMPLICATIONS: None.

 IMPRESSION: Difficult but successful placement of a 50 cm long, single lumen
 Vaxcel catheter in the distal superior vena cava via the left cephalic vein.
 The catheter PICC is ready for use.

Indication: Intraop TEE for pericardial tamponade
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2135-5-9**] at 14:41
Test: TEE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Dynamic interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D
images. Normal LV wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic function
(LVEF>55%).

LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal; basal
anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal inferoseptal - normal;
mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior - normal;
basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal anterolateral
- normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal; septal apex -
normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex - normal;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal ascending aorta diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets with trivial MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets with
physiologic PR.

PERICARDIUM: Moderate pericardial effusion. Effusion is loculated. The
pericardium may be thickened.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the
procedure.

Conclusions:
No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is evidence of
surgical repair of foramen ovale. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber
size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic regurgitation.
The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There was a moderate sized pericardial effusion with some
organization. The effusion appears loculated in the posterior and lateral
segments. The effusion was successfully drained. There was no obvious chamber
collapse though the left atrium was not well seen.. The pericardium may be
thickened.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2132-5-4**].


LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thicknesses and cavity size. Mild global LV
hypokinesis.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Moderate global RV free wall
hypokinesis. Abnormal septal motion/position.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. No MVP.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets with trivial TR.
Indeterminate PA systolic pressure.

PERICARDIUM: Large pericardial effusion. Sgnificant, accentuated respiratory
variation in mitral/tricuspid valve inflows, c/w impaired ventricular filling.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Echocardiographic results were reviewed by telephone with
the houseofficer caring for the patient. Results were reviewed with the
Cardiology Fellow involved with the patient's care.

Conclusions:
Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild
global left ventricular hypokinesis. Right ventricular chamber size is normal
with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets appear
structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. The mitral valve leaflets are
structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. The pulmonary artery
systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a large, circumferential
pericardial effusion extending 2.5-3cm inferior and inferolateral to the left
ventricle, ~1.5-2cm lateral to the left ventricle, 1.5cm around the apex, and
<1cm anterior to the right ventricle. Extensive stranding is seen. Right
ventricular diastolic collapse is not seen, but there is abnormal septal
motion with accentuated respiratory variation in mitral/tricuspid valve
inflows, consistent with impaired ventricular filling/elevated
intrapericardial pressure.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2132-5-4**], the effusion is
larger, prominent stranding and respiratory variation in transmitral Doppler
are now appreciated. Global biventricular hypokinesis is also now present c/w
diffuse process (toxin, metabolic, etc.)

Brief Hospital Course:
Mrs. [**Known lastname 11679**] was admitted and underwent surgical closure of her
patent foramen ovale. The operation was performed minimally
invasive and there were no complications. Following the
procedure, she was brought to the CSRU. She initially remained
hypotensive, requiring volume and Neosynephrine. Within 24
hours, she awoke neurologically intact and was extubated without
difficulty. By postoperative day two, she successfully weaned
from inotropic support. She maintained stable hemodynamics and
transferred to the floor. On telemetry, she remained mostly in a
normal sinus rhythm with brief periods of accelerated junctional
rhythm. She otherwise continued to make clinical improvements
and was cleared for discharge on postoperative day four. She
remained just on Aspirin therapy. Aggrenox was not resumed as
her PFO was surgically repaired. At discharge, her systolic
blood pressures were in the 100's with heart rate of 80-90. Her
room air saturations were 93% and she was ambulating without
difficulty. She had good pain control with Dilaudid and all
wounds were clean, dry and intact.

Pt reports 3-4 weeks ago he noticed an increase of stress at
work and at home at the same time that he was losing weight to
gain better control over his diabetes (40lb in [**5-15**] weeks).  Pt
reports having increasingly frequent panic attacks which he
controlled with Klonopin and occassional Xanax.  He also noticed
decrease in sleep, energy, concentration, interest and
motivation, and an increase in anhedonia over the past [**2-12**]
weeks.
 His psychiatrist began Zoloft which after 3-4 days made him
jittery and this was switched to Celexa which he seems to be
tolerating better, although his neurovegetative sx seem to
worsen.  He denies SI but reports fleeting, ego dystonic
thoughts of hurting his wife, and has not acted on any of these
thoughts.  Pt reports ruminations concerning whether he is
schizophrenic, will have to stay in the hospital forever, or
will be on meds forever.  Pt and wife also report guilt over
allowing two children to develop bad sleeping habits such that
now children and wife sleep in bed and pt sleeps in chair
downstairs.

Brief Hospital Course:
SOMATIC INTERVENTIONS:
The patient was continued on his outpatient medication regimen
of Lexapro, Nortriptyline, Seroquel, Klonopin and Trazodone.  He
was also offerred Ambien at HS as needed.  The patient was
admitted for ECT and was cleared by Medicine and  Anesthesia.
Of note, per ECT consult, the patient's HS and a.m. doses of
Klonopin were held for procudure.  Overnight, prior to transfer,
the DOC was called in response to the patient being agitated and
tremulous reporting ""I'm going to die"".  Fingerstick glucose was
found to be over 300 - in response, the patient was given 10
units NPH and received Ativan 2mg IM with fair effect.  On the
morning of transfer, the patient was again found to be tremulous
and disoriented, repeating that he felt he was going to die.  He
was again given Ativan 2mg IM with minimal effect.  Fingerstick
was checked and found to be 30.  In the process of obtaining
D50, the patient began to demonstrate myoclonic jerking of arms
and legs.  Code was called when the patient became unresponsive.

THERAPEUTIC INTERVENTIONS:
The patient is followed as an outpatient by Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 10166**] who
referred him to the inpatient unit for stabilization of his
significant depression as well as for evaluation for ECT.  Mr.
[**Known lastname 28257**] admitted to significantly low mood since [**Month (only) 205**], and
endorsed neurovegetative symptoms consistent with an agitated
depression.
BEHAVIORAL:
The patient remained in good behavioral control for the duration
of his admission, requiring only 15 minute checks.

stopped shaking and mental status cleared in 30 minutes. He was
started on a dilantin load. He was seen by neuro who felt that
in the setting of hypoglycemia (severe)and withdrawal of his
Klonopin, he was at risk to have a seizure.

EEG
This is a normal EEG in the awake and drowsy states. Note

Brief Hospital Course:
A/P: 50M with history of hypertension, type II diabetes,
originally admitted to psychiatry for [**Month/Day/Year **], made NPO p MN for [**Month/Day/Year **]
in AM with 1/2 dose of insulin, who was found unresponsive and
in apparent seizure state, who was found to have a blood glucose
of 30.
.
1)Convulsions:
A code was called and the patient was given Ativan 2mg po x1, as
well as an amp of D50, loaded with Dilantin and transferred to
the MICU.  The seizure was attributed to his hypoglycemic state,
although psych thought there was an element of Klonopin
withdrawal and thus continued to give Ativan 0.5mg po q4.  Pt
had frequent BS checks in the MICU and patient recovered from
his initial event without any post-seizure sequelae.  Pt
continued to be monitored and had no further events.  Neurology
was consulted for his ? seizure event and after a negative exam
and negative EEG, concluded that it was all due to hypoglycemia,
and that further Dilantin would not be necessary.
Dilantin was d/ced and patient continued to do well.  He was
eventually transferred to the floor.   All home medications were
continued and patient continued to express interest in his [**Month/Day/Year **]
treatment on Monday, although refused to be transferred back to
[**Hospital1 **] 4.
All home medications although his insulin dose (nph 20 qPM) was
halved (--> NPH 10 qPM) on the floor, and his sugars were
running in the 150s-250s range.
Pt was sent home to return for [**Hospital1 **] on Monday as an outpatient.
Explicit instructions were given to take all medications as
normal the night before, including his Klonopin, and only take
[**1-13**] dose of NPH insulin the night before, NPO p MN, no morning
NPH dose, and to cover his elevated morning sugars with Humalog
at a conservative sliding scale.  Goal sugars 150s-250s.

2) Type 2 DM - follow sugars closely
- Continue normal dose insulin while taking POs, and when NPO p
MN for [**Month/Day (4) **] in AM, pt was instructed to take [**1-13**] NPH dose the
evening before, no NPH in the AM, and to cover with Humalog prn
according to conservative insulin SS to prevent hypoglycemic
episodes.
.
3) Depression:
Pt with a h/o refractory depression that was originally admitted
to the psych service for [**Month/Day (4) **].  Psych consult remained aware as
pt was admitted to the MICU and then called out to the floors.
Recommended continuing his Klonopin 3mg po bid for his anxiety,
and added Ativan 0.5mg po q4 for coverage of his anxiety and
alleviation of ? withdrawal during periods when he is off the
Klonopin.  Continued his home doses of Celexa, Nortriptyline,
Seroquel and trazodone for sleep.
Pt was to be discharged to return on Monday for [**Month/Day (4) **] treatments
as an outpatient.
.
4) F/E/N:
-Diabetic diet, replete lytes prn
.
5) Code: full

 MRI EXAM OF THE CERVICAL SPINE

 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Neck pain radiating to the scapula.

 MRI exam of the cervical spine was obtained according to standard departmental
 protocol.  The vertebral bodies demonstrate normal height.  There is mild
 straightening of the normal cervical lordosis.  Sagittal images reveal a small
 cyst in the region of the nasopharynx as indicated on the MRI of the brain.
 Homogeneous signal is seen within the cervical cord.

 The cervicomedullary junction is patent.  No significant abnormalities are
 seen at C2-C3 level.  C3-C4 level reveals annular bulge.  There is mild
 narrowing of the foramina due to uncovertebral and facet hypertrophy.  The
 canal is patent.

 At C4-C5 level, there is moderate narrowing of the left foramen due to
 uncovertebral and facet hypertrophy.  There is a small central disc protrusion
 abutting the ventral aspect of the cord resulting in mild flattening.

 At C5-C6 level, there is central disc herniation slightly encroaching and
 flattening the ventral aspect of the cord.  The foramina are patent.

 At C6-C7 level, there is broad-based shallow central disc protrusion
 contacting and slightly flattening the ventral aspect of the cord.  Mild exit
 neural foraminal stenosis is seen due to uncovertebral and facet hypertrophy.

 At C7-T1 level, there is moderate narrowing of the right foramen due to
 uncovertebral and facet hypertrophy.

 Small central disc protrusions are seen at T1-T2 and T2-T3 levels without cord
 compression noted.

 IMPRESSION:  Multilevel small central disc protrusions seen at C4-C5, C5-C6
 and C6-C7 levels as indicated above.  There is multilevel stenosis of the exit
 neural foramina due to uncovertebral and facet hypertrophy.  Right-sided
 foraminal stenosis is seen at C7-T1 level.  Small upper thoracic disc
 protrusions.

                                 FINAL REPORT  (REVISED)
 HISTORY:  Dens fracture.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired contiguous [**Year (4 digits) 15951**] images of the cervical spine were
 obtained without IV contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reconstructions were
 performed.

 COMPARISON: None.

 CT OF THE CERVICAL SPINE:  A comminuted fracture involving the base of the
 dens is present which extends along the left aspect of the C2 vertebral body
 and exits through the left foramen transversarium.  There is only minimal
 displacement of the fracture fragments, without impingement upon the spinal
 canal.  Minimal prevertebral soft tissue swelling is seen anterior to the C2
 level.  No other fractures or listhesis is identified within the cervical
 spine.

 Multilevel degenerative changes are seen predominantly involving the upper and
 mid cervical vertebral body levels with loss of vertebral body height and
 intervertebral disc space, osteophyte formation, and endplate irregularities.
 The visualized outline of the thecal sac appears unremarkable. The airway is
 patent throughout.  Visualized lung apices are clear.

 IMPRESSION:  Comminuted fracture through the base of the dens and left C2
 vertebral body, extending to involve the left foramen transversarium.  The
 left vertebral artery can be further evaluated with CTA examination.

 NOTE ADDED AT ATTENDING REVIEW: MR [**First Name (Titles) 597**] [**Last Name (Titles) 15951**] fat saturated T1 images, and
 MRA, is the preferred technique to evaluate possible vertebral artery
 dissection. CTA is not an appropriate technique.

 INDICATION:  [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with agitation after a fall and dens fracture,
 rule out intracranial hemorrhage.

 TECHNIQUE:  [**Age over 90 **] non-contrast CT scans of the brain were obtained. Comparison
 is made to an MRI of the brain from [**8-5**] and a CT scan of the brain
 from [**2108-8-5**].

 FINDINGS:

 There is no change in the appearance of the brain, compared to previous
 studies.  No acute hemorrhage is evident.  There are no abnormal extra-[**Year (4 digits) 15951**]
 collections.  There is no intracranial mass effect or shift of structures. The
 ventricles are not dilated.  An old right cerebellar infarction and areas of
 white matter hypodensity, likely chronic microvascular infarction, are noted
 and unchanged.

 There is mucosal thickening in the ethmoid and frontal sinuses and a small
 amount of fluid in the right sphenoid sinus.  The mastoids are aerated.

 IMPRESSION:  Stable appearance of the brain, compared to recent previous
 studies.  No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.

 TECHNIQUE:  CTA neck with multiplanar reconstructions, three-dimensional
 reconstructions.

 FINDINGS:  There is a plaque with ulceration at the origin of the left
 internal carotid artery.  The residual lumen at site of the stenosis is
 approximately 3 mm.  There is also an ulcerative plaque seen in the right
 internal carotid artery at a similar level without significant stenosis.  The
 remainder of the visualized vessels is within normal limits without stenosis,
 extravasation or aneurysm formation.  Calcified plaques are noted in the
 aortic arch.  The visualized soft tissue structures appear unremarkable
 without pathologic enhancement.  The visualized lung portions are unremarkable
 without pneumo- or hemothorax.  Mucosal thickening is noted in the sphenoid
 and bilateral maxillary sinuses without air fluid levels.

 IMPRESSION:  Plaque with ulceration at the proximal left internal carotid
 artery with a residual lumen of 3 mm. This represents a 50% stenosis.
 Ulcerated plaque without significant stenosis in the right proximal internal
 carotid artery. No active extravasation.

 PRELIMINARY REPORT:  No active extravasation.  Proximal right ICA may contain
 a web as there is very focal narrowing.  Proximal left ICA has an area that
 may represent an ulcerative plaque or early dissection. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 425**] MDMBA

 THREE VIEWS OF THE LEFT KNEE:

 There is a fracture of the inferior patella transfixed by a cerclage wire. The
 fracture margins appear indistinct and old.

 There is a joint effusion, with an equivocal fat-fluid level. The oblique view
 demonstrates a vertical linear lucency with could represent an more acute non-
 displaced fracture. If the hardware in the patella was not placed in the past
 several weeks or months, then that lucency does indeed represent a new non-
 displaced patellar fracture.  No other acute fracture is identified about the
 knee.

 IMPRESSION:

 Old patellar fracture transfixed by cerclage wire.  Probable new nondisplaced
 patellar fracture.

 ADDENDUM [**2108-8-10**] -  Please note that the original house officer dictation did
 not reflect the presence of the joint effusion or suspected acute fracture.

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **]yo M s/p fall with dens fx, change in MS
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o vascular injury (CTA neck only)
CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

INDICATION: Status post fall with dens fracture, change in
mental status. Rule out vascular injury. CTA neck only.

TECHNIQUE: CTA neck with multiplanar reconstructions,
three-dimensional reconstructions.

FINDINGS: There is a plaque with ulceration at the origin of the
left internal carotid artery. The residual lumen at site of the
stenosis is approximately 3 mm. There is also an ulcerative
plaque seen in the right internal carotid artery at a similar
level without significant stenosis. The remainder of the
visualized vessels is within normal limits without stenosis,
extravasation or aneurysm formation. Calcified plaques are noted
in the aortic arch. The visualized soft tissue structures appear
unremarkable without pathologic enhancement. The visualized lung
portions are unremarkable without pneumo- or hemothorax. Mucosal
thickening is noted in the sphenoid and bilateral maxillary
sinuses without air fluid levels.

IMPRESSION: Plaque with ulceration at the proximal left internal
carotid artery with a residual lumen of 3 mm. This represents a
50% stenosis. Ulcerated plaque without significant stenosis in
the right proximal internal carotid artery. No active
extravasation.

PRELIMINARY REPORT: No active extravasation. Proximal right ICA
may contain a web as there is very focal narrowing. Proximal
left ICA has an area that may represent an ulcerative plaque or
early dissection. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Doctor Last Name 18954**] MDMBA

CONTRAINDICATIONS for IV CONTRAST: None.

CT SCAN OF THE BRAIN, [**2108-8-7**]

INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man with agitation after a fall and dens
fracture, rule out intracranial hemorrhage.

TECHNIQUE: Axial non-contrast CT scans of the brain were
obtained. Comparison is made to an MRI of the brain from
[**8-5**] and a CT scan of the brain from [**2108-8-5**].

FINDINGS:

There is no change in the appearance of the brain, compared to
previous studies. No acute hemorrhage is evident. There are no
abnormal extra-axial collections. There is no intracranial mass
effect or shift of structures. The ventricles are not dilated.
An old right cerebellar infarction and areas of white matter
hypodensity, likely chronic microvascular infarction, are noted
and unchanged.

There is mucosal thickening in the ethmoid and frontal sinuses
and a small amount of fluid in the right sphenoid sinus. The
mastoids are aerated.

IMPRESSION: Stable appearance of the brain, compared to recent
previous studies. No evidence of acute intracranial hemorrhage.

KNEE (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) LEFT  [**2108-8-8**] 1:38 PM

KNEE (AP, LAT & OBLIQUE) LEFT

Reason: r/o fx

[**Hospital 93**] MEDICAL CONDITION:
[**Age over 90 **] year old man s/p fall
REASON FOR THIS EXAMINATION:
r/o fx
INDICATION: [**Age over 90 **]-year-old man status post fall. Evaluate for
fracture.

THREE VIEWS OF THE LEFT KNEE:

There is a fracture of the inferior patella transfixed by a
cerclage wire. The fracture margins appear indistinct and old.

There is a joint effusion, with an equivocal fat-fluid level.
The oblique view demonstrates a vertical linear lucency with
could represent an more acute non- displaced fracture. If the
hardware in the patella was not placed in the past several weeks
or months, then that lucency does indeed represent a new non-
displaced patellar fracture. No other acute fracture is
identified about the knee.

IMPRESSION:

Old patellar fracture transfixed by cerclage wire. Probable new
nondisplaced patellar fracture.

ADDENDUM [**2108-8-10**] - Please note that the original house officer
dictation did not reflect the presence of the joint effusion or
suspected acute fracture. This change in [**Location (un) 1131**] was discussed
with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 17148**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 2819**] on [**2108-8-10**] at 2:45 pm, who confirms that the old
patellar fracture was remote.


Brief Hospital Course:
Patient admitted to the trauma service. Orthopedic Spine was
immediately consulted because of his cervical spine injuries.
Recommended non-surgical intervention with cervical collar for
2-3 months. Neurosurgery consulted for patient's cervical
fracture as well, recommendations for further radiologic imaging
to evaluate for any vertebral artery dissection and monitoring
neurological status. Vascular surgery consulted for likely
dissection of left ICA, recommendations for ASA for
anticoagulation; no Heparin given history falls; and re imaging
if patient develops signs and symptoms. Geriatrics consulted
given patient's mechanism of injury; delirium identified and
recommendations made re: treating his delirium; Olanzapine
started; bone densitometry while in rehab to screen for
osteoporosis and initiating Calcium with Vit D.  Speech and
Swallow consulted for his dysphagia; bedside swallow study
performed. Recommendations for nectar thick liquids and ground
diet. Physical therapy consulted due to patient's decreased
functional mobility and falls; recommendations for rehab stay
after discharge from hospital. Patient sustained a mechanical
fall during his hospitalization; a head CT scan and films of his
left knee were obtained; no intracranial hemorrhage identified.
Knee films revealed questionable non displaced patellar
fracture, Orthopedics was consulted and recommended a knee
immobilizer and and follow up in 3 weeks.

Date of Birth:   [**2107-6-13**]       Sex:  F

Service:  Cardiothoracic Surgery

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65 year old female
with a 20 year history of hypertension and a ten year history
of Type 2 diabetes who demonstrated a positive exercise
stress test in [**2183-3-1**] suggestive for possible coronary
artery disease.  The patient received a stress test as part
of a risk stratification workup and at no point demonstrated
any evidence of chest pain.  A subsequent exercise MIBI study
performed [**2183-3-28**] revealed an exercise capacity of
only 2 minutes 15 seconds on the [**Doctor First Name **] protocol.  There was
no chest pain noted on the test and the peak exercise
electrocardiogram showed 1.5 to 2 mm horizontal to upsloping
ST depression in the inferior leads and in V1 and V2.
Imaging studies revealed a large apical to a small anterior
defect that was reversible.  The patient's ejection fraction
was noted to be 56% with normal wall motion.  The patient
subsequently underwent a cardiac catheterization on [**2183-4-22**] which demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease
and mild diastolic ventricular dysfunction.  The patient was
thereafter referred to Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**] for surgical
evaluation and was subsequently scheduled for a coronary
artery bypass graft on [**2183-4-28**].

HOSPITAL COURSE:  On [**2183-4-28**], the patient underwent a
coronary artery bypass graft times three with grafts from the
left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending,
saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery and
saphenous vein graft to the obtuse marginal.  The patient
tolerated the procedure well.  The patient's pericardium was
left open.  Lines were placed including an arterial line and
a Swan-Ganz catheter ; both atrial and ventricular wires were
placed; tubes placed included in a mediastinal and bilateral
pleural tubes.  The patient was subsequently transferred to
the Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit, intubated, for further
evaluation and management.  Shortly after arriving in the
Cardiac Surgery Recovery Unit, the patient was easily weaned
and extubated without complication.  On postoperative day #1,
the patient was noted to be stable for transfer to the floor
and was subsequently admitted to the Cardiothoracic Service
under the direction of Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 1537**].  The patient's
postoperative course was uneventful and she progressed well
clinically.  On postoperative day #1, the patient's chest
tube and Foley catheter were successfully removed without
complications.  Follow up chest x-ray demonstrated no
evidence of pneumothorax, and the patient was noted to be
independently productive of adequate amounts of urine for the
duration of her stay.  Physical therapy performed an initial
evaluation with the patient and followed her progress for the
duration of her stay.  On postoperative day #3, the patient's
pacer wires were removed without complications and her
sternal incision was noted to be clean, dry and intact with
Steri-Strips in place.  The patient was successfully advanced
to a regular diet, which she tolerated well and was noted to
have adequate pain control via oral pain medications.  The
patient steadily advanced in her ability to ambulate freely
and was subsequently cleared for discharge to home by
physical therapy.  The patient was subsequently cleared for
discharge to home on postoperative day #4, [**2183-5-3**], with
instructions for follow up.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  The patient is to be discharged to
home with instructions for follow up.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  Stable.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is severely depressed with mid to distal/apical akinesis. The basal segments
contract best. No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears
depressed. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic
stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The
tricuspid valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

 PORTABLE AP CHEST:  Comparison is made to study performed one day prior.
 Nasogastric tube is coiled within the stomach.  There has been interval
 placement of a right femoral approach Swan-Ganz catheter, which likely
 terminates within the main pulmonary artery trunk.  In addition, intraaortic
 balloon pump is in satisfactory position, approximately 5 cm below the aortic
 arch.  There are low lung volumes, cardiomegaly, and persistent interstitial
 edema.  Dense left retrocardiac density is consistent with atelectasis, but
 underlying pneumonia cannot be excluded.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Termination of Swan-Ganz catheter within the main pulmonary artery.
 2.  No significant interval change in mild pulmonary edema and left lower lobe
 atelectasis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest AP portable single view.

 INDICATION:  Dyspnea, end stage renal disease, evolving myocardial infarction
 and cardiogenic shock.  Just re-adjusted position of pulmonary catheter
 placement giving right ventricular pressure tracing.

 FINDINGS:  AP single view of the patient in sitting semi-upright position is
 analyzed in direct comparison with a similar preceding study of [**9-14**].
 During the interval, the Swan-Ganz pulmonary catheter approached from below
 has been removed.  On previous examination, bilateral mostly centrally located
 pulmonary densities have regressed some slightly and demonstrate improvement
 of the edema pattern.  No new parenchymal infiltrates are identified.

 The position of the Swan-Ganz catheter tip on the preceding study was just at
 the level of the pulmonary valve.  Consequently the possibility that the
 catheter tip still remaining in the outflow tract of the right ventricle is
 apparent. Secure position of PA catheters could have the distal 2-3 cm at
 least in the proximal portion of the right main stem or the left main stem.

 IMPRESSION:  Removal of Swan-Ganz catheter.  No pneumothorax.  Edema pattern.

 Cardiac and mediastinal contours are stable.  There is persistent atelectasis
 at the right lung base with increased opacity and associated volume loss.
 There has been slight interval improvement in areas of opacification within
 the left mid and lower lung zones with some air bronchograms visualized in the
 left retrocardiac region.  Review of recent radiographs of [**9-16**] and 21,
 [**2133**] demonstrated more extensive opacity suggestive of diffuse pulmonary
 edema.  It is uncertain whether the residual opacity in the left lung reflect
 slowly resolving edema or if there is a superimposed process such as
 infection.

 Bilateral small pleural effusions are noted.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT

 HISTORY:  87-year-old man with hemodialysis graft in the right upper extremity
 with no thrill, difficult access, and bounding pulse.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 168**] and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 16**], Attending Radiologist, present
 and supervising the entire procedure.

 FINDINGS/TECHNIQUE:  The patient was placed supine on the angiographic table
 after appropriate consent was obtained.  The right arm was prepped and draped
 in sterile fashion.  The graft was accessed with a 21-gauge needle after 1%
 lidocaine was used for local anesthesia.  The 0.018 guidewire was advanced
 toward the central venous circulation and the needle was exchanged for a 4.5-
 French introducer sheath.  Venogram performed with and without placement of a
 tourniquet over the axillary vein demonstrated tight venous stenosis
 immediately adjacent to the anastomosis between the graft and the brachial
 vein.  Based on the diagnostic findings, it was decided that the patient was a
 good candidate for and would benefit from angioplasty.  0.035 [**Last Name (un) 180**] wire was
 placed into the sheath and the sheath was exchanged for a 5- French
 angiographic sheath. 6 mm, 2 cm, and 8 mm, 4 cm balloons were used for
 sequential balloon dilatation of the venous stenosis. A followup venogram
 demonstrated substantial improvement in the luminal diameter of the brachial
 veins adjacent to the graft-to-vein anastomosis.

 COMPLICATIONS:  No immediate complications.

 IMPRESSION:  Angiogram of the AV graft in the right arm demonstrated tight
 stenosis of the brachial vein adjacent to the graft-to-vein anastomosis.
 Angioplasty with 6 mm and 8 mm none-cutting balloons was performed with good
 results.

peripheral vascular disease presents with chest pain and
shortness of breath. He reports that his chest pain began
approximately one week ago. During the week it has gotten worse.
It is substernal, radiating to left shoulder, especially with
inspiration. It is associated with shortness of breath. He came
to the hospital today because the pain was much worse, [**9-6**]. In
addition, he noted today black stools. He has been taking iron.
He reports lightheadedness. Denies nausea, vomiting,
diaphoresis, arm paresthesias. He has also noticed a cough
recently but has not been able to produce sputum (though he
feels congested).
.
The pt was seen in Geriatric Urgent Care clinic on [**9-11**] for
dyspnea. He noted worsening in the supine position. An CXR at
the time to evaluate possible CHF showed ""No evidence of
congestive heart failure or pneumonia. Elevation of the right
hemidiaphragm"".
.
In the ED, the patient was given 80mg IV lasix x 2 with UOP of
100-200cc. He received nitropaste, lopressor IV and [**Last Name (LF) **], [**First Name3 (LF) **], and
morphine, and was started on a nitro gtt. Heparin was started as
well, and 1 unit PRBCs was transfused. He was given one dose of
protonix, levofloxacin and . BPs were in the 110s-120s/50s-60s,
HR 70s-80s. Renal, GI, and cardiology consults were called. The
patient continued to report [**9-6**] pain, eventually decreased to
[**6-6**] with titration of the nitro gtt. On arrival in the CCU, he
still reported [**6-6**] pain. He was on nitro at 120 mcg/min and
heparin at 850 units/hr.

pressures. (PCWP = 25 mmhg).
2. Left heart catheterization revealed no evidence of systolic
hypertension.  Calculated cardiac output and index were 5.0/2.8.

3. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system
revealed
three vessel coronary artery disease.  The left main coronary
artery had
a 40% mid-vessel stenosis.  The left anterior descending artery
had
diffuse proximal disease with serial 70-80% stenosis.  The left
anterior
descending had mild diffuse disease in the mid and distal
segments.  The
large first diagonal had an 80% proximal lesion.  The left
circumflex
coronary artery had mild diffuse disease in the proximal, mid,
and
distal segments.  There was a subtotal occlusion of the OM1.
The right
coronary artery was the dominant vessel.  There was total
occlusion of
the right coronary artery in the proximal segment.  The distal
RCA
filled via collaterals from the LCA septal branches.
4. No left ventriculography was undertaken given elevated Cr.
5. Successful predilation using 2.0 X 12 sprinter balloon and
stenting
using a minivision 2.5 X 23 stent of the proximal OM1 with
lesion
reduction from 99 to 0%
6. Successful predilaton using a 2.0 X 20 Maverick balloon and
stenting
using 3.0 X 30 Driver stent of the proximal LAD with lesion
reduction
from 80% to 0%.
7. Successful predilation using 2.0 X 12 sprinter balloon and
stenting
using a 2.25 X 15 minivision stent of the proximal D1 with
lesion
reduction from 80% to 0%. The final angiogram showed TIMI III
flow in
the vessels intervened with no residual stenoses in any of the
stents.
Thre was no distal embolisation or dissection noted in any
vessel.
8. Successful insertion of IABP via right femoral artery.
( see PTCA comments for the above procdures from 5 through to 8)

9. At the request of the renal consultants, a 12 French Dialysis
central
venous catheter was placed using the Seldinger technique in the
left
common femoral vein.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Elevated right and left sided pressures.
3. Preserved cardiac output/cardiac index.
4. Successful stenting of the OM, LAD and D1.
5. Successful insertion of IABP via right femoral artery.
6. Successful implantation of a central venous dialysis catheter
in the
left femoral vein.

         REQUESTED BY DR. [**Last Name (STitle) 9974**] ON [**2134-9-21**]..


Brief Hospital Course:
1. Rhythm: pt had 2 episodes of monomorphic VT accompanied by
fall in BP, LOC, terminated x 1 via precordial thumb.
Electrolytes were repeleted, pt was bolused with Amiodarone x 2,
and started on an Amio gtt. Amiodarone was then changed to po,
with a dosing schedule of 400 mg [**Hospital1 **] for one week, followed by
400 mg daily for one week, then 200 mg per day.  Monomorphic VT
thought to be likely due to a fixed area of scarring from
previous MI.  Placement of an ICD was discussed.  However, given
the pt's poor prognosis for non sudden cardiac death reasons,
and given his increased infectious risk, it was decided to treat
his arrhythmia medically.  Of note, the QT interval was
prolonged (506), likely secondary to amiodarone.  Patient
remained in sinus rhythm on Amiodarone.
2. CAD: Pt with NSTEMI. Cath on [**9-12**] showed 3 vessel disease,
subsequently underwent successful stenting of OM, D1, LAD and
IABP placement. IABP was discontinued after the patient was able
to maintain his own pressure.
Echo completed on [**9-13**], which showed apical akinesis, with
severely depressed systolic function.  Patient was initially
started on heparin and bridged to Coumadin, however, he had
another episode of guaiac positive stool, and given his history
of melena and coffee ground emesis, the risk for GI bleed was
thought to be high and anticoagulation was discontinued.
The patient was continued on an aspirin, Statin, beta blocker,
and was started on an ACE, all of which he will continue as an
outpatient.  His swan and sheath were discontinued without
complications.
3.PUMP: CHF: EF 20% by ECHO
He was initially placed on Imdur/Hydral for afterload reduction
and an ACE was initially avoided in an attempt to salvage his
kidneys.  However, he was eventually started on low-dose
lisinopril to be titrated up if necessary.  Patient also
underwent hemodialysis on Mon/Wed/Fri schedule.
4. Renal: Chronic renal disease, secondary to hypertensive
nephrosclerosis, is status post graft placement with mature A-V
graft. Quentin catheter initially used, then discontinued once
graft accessible.  On [**9-22**], graft noted to be difficult to
access per renal, patient underwent AV fistulogram, and
successful angioplasty was performed.
5. ID: Patient completed a seven day course of levofloxacin for
suspected pneumonia, white blood count noted to be persistently
elevated.  Patient was pan cultured, and a urine culture was
positive for yeast.  Foley catheter was discontinued and a
repeat culture was sent, also positive for [**Female First Name (un) **].  Patient
started on a 2 week course of Fluconazole.  Blood cultures
pending at time of discharge, no growth to date.
6. Heme: anemia, likely anemia of chronic disease from chronic
renal disease.  Patient also had an episode of melena and coffee
ground emesis, guaiac positive stool.  Hematocrit was followed,
and patient was transfused as necessary to keep hematocrit above
30.  Patient will need GI workup as an outpatient. Oral iron
supplementation was discontinued as patient receiving Fe in
addition to EPO and Procrit at hemodialysis
7. DM: Patient was started on glargine for persistent
hyperglycemia and covered with a regular insulin sliding scale
with Accu-Check to monitor.
8. Psych: Patient was continued on his home dose of Zoloft 100
mg once daily.
Patient tolerated a low Na/cardiac healthy diet and was placed
on a PPI for GI prophylaxis.
Patient was discharged to rehab facility with plan to follow up
with cardiology and PCP within the next month.

 The heart size is normal but demonstrates left ventricular configuration.
 Pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits allowing for supine positioning.
 There is marked elevation of the right hemidiaphragm which is increased in
 degree of elevation since the previous radiograph.  Adjacent opacity is noted
 in the middle and lower lobe.  The presence of volume loss favors atelectasis.
 Additional patchy opacity is seen in the left retrocardiac region, and may be
 due to atelectasis or pneumonia.  Followup radiographs are suggested.

LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Normal RA size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Normal LV cavity size. Severe
regional LV systolic dysfunction. No resting LVOT gradient. No LV
mass/thrombus.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: RV function depressed. Paradoxic septal motion consistent
with conduction abnormality/ventricular pacing.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is severe regional
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with akinesis of the distal LV and apex.
The remaining segments are hypokinetic (the basal septum and lateral wall
contract best). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic
regurgitation. There is no aortic valve stenosis. The mitral valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. The mitral valve leaflets are elongated. Mild (1+)
mitral regurgitation is seen. The mitral regurgitation jet is eccentric. The
left ventricular inflow pattern suggests impaired relaxation. There is mild
pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2134-9-13**], no diagnostic
change.

 INDICATION:  87-year-old man with gram positive sepsis, question abscess.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the abdomen and pelvis from [**2133-10-19**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector CT scanning was performed from the level of the lung
 bases to the level of the pubic symphysis after the administration of IV and
 oral contrast.  Coronal and sagittal reformations were obtained.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN:  Bilateral small pleural effusions are seen, right greater
 than left.  A partially calcified pleural plaque is seen along the right
 anterior pleural surface.  There are dependent changes in the lung bases
 bilaterally.  The visualized heart and pericardium appear unremarkable.  In
 the liver are multiple new low-density lesions, the largest of which in
 segment 8 measures 5.1 x 3.6 cm.  Again seen is a calcified gallstone in the
 neck of the gallbladder, without evidence of gallbladder wall thickening or
 pericholecystic fluid.  The spleen has a mottled appearance to it with
 possible areas of hypodensity, but does not have discrete measurable lesions
 within it.  The adrenal glands and pancreas appear unremarkable.  There is a
 small amount of perihepatic ascites as well as fluid within the left paracolic
 gutter.  The opacified loops of small bowel appear normal in caliber and
 contour.  The kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically, and have
 unchanged surrounding non-specific fat stranding. Stable multiple rounded
 hypodensities are seen in the kidneys bilaterally, which are incompletely
 characterized on this study, but likely represent simple cysts. Included in
 these is a 1.9-cm left parapelvic cyst.

 The colonic wall is diffusely edematous from the cecum to the rectum.  A 1.9 x
 2.3 x 3.7-cm ovoid opacity is seen adjacent to the ascending colon, with clear
 tissue planes between it and the colon as well as the right kidney.  There is
 atherosclerosis of the abdominal aorta and its major branches, but the major
 arteries and veins appear patent. There is no pathologic mesenteric or
 retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy.  There is no free air within the abdomen.

 CT OF THE PELVIS:  A Foley catheter is seen within the urinary bladder, with
 some air within the bladder lumen.  The prostate and seminal vesicles appear
 unremarkable.  Again seen is the colonic wall edema extending to the rectum.
 There is an extensive amount of free fluid within the pelvis.  Two fluid
 collections are identified in the left inguinal region, measuring 1.8 and 1.8
 cm respectively.  The distal aortic bypass graft is again identified. There is
                                                             (Over)

 (Cont)
 no pathologic pelvic or inguinal lymphadenopathy seen.

 The osseous structures do not show any concerning lytic or sclerotic lesions.
 There is degenerative change of the lumbar spine.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Pancolitis extending from the rectum to the cecum.  Given this patient's
 recent antibiotic use, infectious etiologies are of concern.  Likely enlarged
 lymph node adjacent to the ascending colon, though a small abscess in this
 region is possible though less likely.
 2.  Multiple hypodensities of varying sizes within the liver are concerning
 for abscesses in this patient with bacteremia.  Additionally, there is a
 mottled appearance to the spleen which may indicate splenic involvement.
 3.  Ascites and large amount of free fluid within the pelvis.  Two small fluid
 collections in the left inguinal region are likely postoperative in nature
 given recent instrumentation.
 4.  Cholelithiasis without evidence of cholecystitis.

 These findings were discussed with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 39**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 15968**] at 11:15 a.m. on [**2135-2-1**], as well as with [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 561**] at 1:45 p.m. the same day.

 INDICATION:  Peripheral vascular disease and ulcer on left heel, evaluate for
 osteomyelitis.

 COMPARISON:  Plain radiographs of left foot dated [**2135-1-31**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar T1, T2, and STIR images of the left foot with sagittal
 and coronal pre- and post-contrast T1-weighted images.

 MR OF THE LEFT FOOT WITHOUT AND WITH GADOLINIUM:  There is diffuse edema
 within the subcutaneous tissues and deep soft tissues about the left heel and
 ankle as well as within the plantar aspect of the foot.  No focal ulcer crater
 is identified.  The marrow signal within the underlying osseous structures
 appears normal without evidence of marrow edema.  The joint spaces are
 preserved.  Following the administration of gadolinium, enhancement cannot be
 fully evaluated due to lack of fat saturation on the post-contrast images.
 There is no joint effusion.

 IMPRESSION:  Diffuse edema within the subcutaneous and deep tissues.  No
 evidence of  osteomyelitis.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Mental status change in the setting of septic shock with probable
 liver abscesses.  Evaluate for abscess.

 COMPARISON:  MRI and MRA of the brain dated [**2128-8-10**].

 TECHNIQUE:  CT of the head was performed without additional administration of
 IV contrast.  The patient received 150 cc of IV Optiray contrast earlier on
 the day of the exam for an abdomen/pelvis study.  Thus, the extent of
 enhancement of normal vascular structures is limited.

 FINDINGS:  There are no definite areas of acute intracranial hemorrhage,
 although prior contrast administration limits the evaluation.  There is no
 shift of the normally midline structures.  The ventricles and cisterns are
 unchanged from prior study, noted above.  Hypodensity of the white matter of
 the left occipital lobe as well as bilateral periventricular white matter
 within each cerebral hemisphere is consistent with chronic microvascular
 infarction, and appears to be unchanged from [**2128-7-28**], as seen on this
 prior MRI exam. The visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are
 clear.

 The scout image demonstrates mild anterolisthesis of C3 on C4, likely
 degenerative in origin.

 IMPRESSION:  Probably unchanged appearance of the brain compared to [**Month (only) 876**]
 [**2127**].  There are areas of chronic microvascular ischemia/infarction in both
 cerebral hemispheres. There are no definite abscesses identified, although the
 exam is slightly limited as IV contrast was administered several hours prior
 to the performance of this study.

 HISTORY:  CHF.

 Single portable chest radiograph again demonstrates a left internal jugular
 central venous catheter with its tip at the junction of the SVC and left
 brachiocephalic vein.  Lung volumes are low, limiting assessment.  There is
 likely mild, bilateral, pulmonary edema.  There is mild blunting of the
 bilateral costophrenic angles, representing small bilateral pleural effusions.
 Trachea is midline.  No pneumothorax.

 IMPRESSION:
 Left internal jugular central venous catheter in satisfactory position.

 Low lung volume slightly limits assessment, but there is probably mild

Brief Hospital Course:
Assessment and plan:
87 yo M with MMP including DM, HTN, CAD, PVD on HD with L arm
fistula presents with septic shock.
.
1. Sepsis:
The pt was found to be hypotensive and febrile in the ED and
admitted through sepsis protocol. He was infused with muliple
boluses of normal saline, put on levophed for blood pressure
support. He was covered with broad spectrum antibiotic
empirically as culture data was sent. Blood cultures were found
to be positive for gram postive cocci which was ultimately shown
to be VRE. Vancomycin was changed to linezolid. The pt remained
hypotensive on pressors for the next several days and a work-up
was initiated to determine the source of infection. MRI of the
foot was pursued to r/o osteomyelitis, and a CT of the abdomen
was down to r/o an abdominal source of infection.
   The CT Abdomen and pelvis showed possible abscess in liver
and spleen. There was also pancolitis. GI and Surgery were
[**Year/Month/Day 4221**] for assistance in the management of these problems.
For the pancolitis, the pt was kept NPO and he was treated for
possible c. diff infection while c. diff cultures were sent and
found to be positive. A RUQ U/S [**2135-2-2**] was pursued which showed
evidence of hypoechoic lesion could be flegmon or mass. It was
unable to be confirmed on imaging whether these lesions on CT
which were new compared with a previous scan in [**10-1**] were
abscesses vs possible mets from an unknown primary. IR was
[**Date Range 4221**] for possible drainage or biopsy, however option
declined given localization of lesions and the pts significant
bleeding risk. The GI team suggested an MRI to further evaluate
the liver lesions although this was unable to be pursued because
the pt was too unstable requiring pressors for bp support. A TTE
Echo was done to r/o endocarditis or abscess and was negative.
Head CT was negative for abscess as well.
.
2. CMO:
On the morning of [**2135-2-6**], the ICU team discussed with Mr
[**Known lastname **] wife and daughter the different alternatives for Mr
[**Known lastname **] care. It was explained that the feeling of the medical
staff and nurse staff was that Mr [**Known lastname **] has been extremily
uncomfortable with all the procedures that he undergoes during
the day. Despite giving pain medicines he has shown signs of a
lot of discomfort. We explained to the family that we would need
a NGT place in order to feed him and give him some of his
medicines now that he is having trouble swallowing given his
mental status. Also we have explained that we still not have a
clear dx on his liver lesions, and in order to obtained a dx he
might need a surgical intervention for biopsy. It would be a
long road ahead before he is able to go back to where he was
previously.
Ms [**Known lastname **] feels that her husband would not want to have all this
procedures done along the road and that we should change the
focus of care towards making him as comfortable as possible.
    The antibiotics and pressors were d/c'ed. The plan was to
have no more dialysis. There were no more lab draws. A morphine
drip was started for pain. The pt remained arousable though
sleepy. His blood pressure was in the 80s-90s systolic off
pressors and his extremities continued to show evidence of
perfusion. On the evening of [**12-10**], he skin became more pale and
his sensorium less alert. At 2:08 am he was found to have ceased
respirations and was without a heart rate on the monitor. By
2:15 am he was pronounced deceased.
.
2. CAD: h/o MI.
Continued sinvastatin, aspirin until made CMO. BB and BP
medications were held in the setting of hypotension
.
3. Peripheral vascular disease: continued plavix, Aspirin until
CMO
The vascular team followed the pt.
.
4. DM: insulin sliding scale was continued before the pt was
made CMO.
.
#. ESRD: The pt continued to recieve periodic dialysis sessions
while in house until he was made CMO.
.
#. FEN:
He was kept NPO given the colitis and sepsis.
.
# Hypothyroidism: continued levothyroxine until CMO.
.
# PPX: Pantoprazole, pneumoboots until CMO.
.
#Code: DNR-DNI was changed to CMO on [**2-6**]

 respectively.  The ICA end-diastolic velocity is 2.  The ICA/CCA ratio is 0.8.
 This is consistent with less than 40% stenosis.

 On the left, peak velocities are 81, 58, and 82 at the ICA, CCA, and ECA
 respectively.  The ICA end-diastolic velocity is 17.  The ICA/CCA ratio is
 1.4.  This is consistent with less than 40% stenosis.

 There is antegrade vertebral artery flow bilaterally.

 IMPRESSION:  Bilateral less than 40% ICA stenosis.

Service:  ICU

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Unresponsiveness

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:   The patient is a 64-year-old
female with a history of hypertension, depression, prior
suicide attempt by overdose, recently with exacerbated mood
disorder status post the death of her husband in [**2195-6-2**], now presented after being found unresponsive.  The
patient's daughters found her in the morning of the day of
presentation, unresponsive with empty bottles of Ambien and
Zyprexa at the bedside.  Pill count revealed that the patient
had likely taken 26 Ambien and 12 Zyprexa.  The patient has
been unable to be alone secondary to depression with suicidal
ideation, and has been living with her daughters.  They note
that the patient went to bed at 11 P.M. the night prior to
admission and was found at 11 A.M. unresponsive with
respiratory depression.  The patient had seen her primary
psychiatrist the day before.

In the Emergency Department, the patient was charcoaled,
gastric lavaged, and intubated for airway protection.  She
was hemodynamically stable.  She was transferred to the
Intensive Care Unit.

In the Intensive Care Unit, the patient was able to open her
eyes, and was moving all four extremities and responsive to
command.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hypertension
2.  Depression with suicide attempt ten years ago by
overdose.  The patient was hospitalized for two weeks at that
point.  The patient's outpatient psychiatrist is Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].

ALLERGIES:   No known drug allergies.

MEDICATIONS:   Zyprexa 2.5 mg by mouth daily at bedtime,
Zestril 20 mg by mouth once daily, Ambien 10 mg by mouth
daily at bedtime, Estradiol 1 mg by mouth once daily,
nortriptyline 25 mg by mouth daily at bedtime, Klonopin 0.5
to 1 mg daily at bedtime, Biotin and calcium supplementation.

SOCIAL HISTORY:   The patient lives with her daughter.  [**Name (NI) **]
husband died in [**2196-1-2**].  The patient denied any
tobacco, alcohol or drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Unknown.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:   The patient's temperature was 97.7,
with a blood pressure of 130/65, pulse of 84, respiratory
rate of 14, and oxygen saturation of 100%.  The patient was
ventilated on IMV pressure support with a rate of 14,
pressure support of 10, PEEP of 7.5, volume of 500, and 40%
FIO2.  On general examination, the patient was a very
ill-appearing female, in no apparent distress.  She was
intubated.  Head, eyes, ears, nose and throat examination
revealed 1 to 2 mm nonreactive pupils.  Neck examination
revealed no jugular venous distention and no bruits.  Cardiac
examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and
S2, and no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Pulmonary examination
revealed that the lungs were clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  Abdominal examination revealed a belly that was
soft, nontender, nondistended, with normal bowel sounds.
Extremity examination revealed no edema, with 2+ dorsalis
pedis pulses bilaterally.  Neurological examination revealed
a patient that was moving all four extremities, opening eyes
intermittently, withdrawing to pain.  The patient had 2+ deep
tendon reflexes, and downgoing plantar reflexes.

LABORATORY DATA:   The patient had a white blood cell count
of 5.1, hematocrit of 35.9, platelets of 259.  The patient
had a sodium of 140, potassium of 4.4, chloride of 103,
bicarbonate of 28, BUN of 17, creatinine of 0.6, and glucose
of 102.  The patient's INR was 1.1.  The patient had an ALT
of 19, an AST of 26.  Arterial blood gas was performed
post-intubation and was found to be pH of 7.47, PACO2 of 29,
and PAO2 of 287.

Electrocardiogram:  Normal sinus rhythm at 80, with normal
axis, [**Doctor Last Name 1754**] and intervals, and ST elevations in V2 and
Lead I.

Other studies:  Urine toxicology was negative, serum
toxicology was negative.  Urinalysis revealed negative
nitrates, leukocytes, blood, no red blood cells, no white
blood cells, occasional bacteria, and less than one
epithelial cell.

Head CT:  No signs of intracranial hemorrhage or mass effect.

HOSPITAL COURSE:   The patient is a 64-year-old female with a
history of hypertension and depression with suicidal ideation
and previous history of overdose attempt, status post likely
overdose on Ambien and Zyprexa, status post intubation and
hemodynamically stable.

1.  Toxicology:  Patient with likely Ambien overdose and
Zyprexa overdose.  Her symptoms of light coma, somnolence and
respiratory compromise were consistent with Ambien overdose.
The patient also had evidence of myosis, which was consistent
with Zyprexa overdose.  The patient had been gastric lavaged,
charcoaled and supported in the Emergency Department.  In the
Intensive Care Unit, the patient was supported with
intravenous fluids and gradually weaned on the ventilator to
the point where she was successfully extubated shortly after
arriving to the Intensive Care Unit.

2.  Psychiatric:  Patient with major depression, recently
exacerbated by the loss of her husband, now with a second
overdose attempt in her lifetime.  Likely Zyprexa and Ambien
were the agents responsible.  Multiple attempts were made in
the effort to contact the patient's outpatient psychiatrist,
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **].  She was unable to be reached.  Psychiatry was
consulted, who felt that the patient needed inpatient
evaluation and treatment.  They also recommended
psychotropics be avoided, and that the patient have a
one-to-one sitter.  Social Work and Case Management were
consulted.

3.  Cardiovascular:  Patient was hemodynamically stable with
history of hypertension.  Her antihypertensives were held.
Her electrocardiogram was unremarkable, although there were
no studies for comparison.

4.  Pulmonary:  Patient intubated secondary to decreased
mental status without a primary lung process.
Post-extubation arterial blood gas did not suggest any
obstructive lung process leading to hypercarbia or hypoxemia
from other pulmonary process.  The examination was
unremarkable.  A facile extubation was anticipated, and the
patient was extubated within several hours of arriving in the
Intensive Care Unit.

5.  Psychosocial:  Communication was maintained with the
patient's daughters, who also felt that the patient should
receive inpatient evaluation and treatment.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:   Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  The patient was discharged to an inpatient
psychiatric bed.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:   Zestril 20 mg by mouth once daily,
Estradiol 1 mg by mouth once daily.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS:
1.  Major depression
2.  Ambien and Zyprexa overdose
3.  Hypertension

 FINDINGS:  Compared to the prior study the previously identified radiopaque
 density in the  the left subclavian region is no longer identified and
 presumably this was an artifact or  outside the patient.  Since the previous
 exam the patient has been extubated.

 The lungs are clear without evidence for focal consolidation, or fluid
 overload.  Heart size is normal.

 IMPRESSION:

 Normal chest.  The concern of the previous radiopaque catheter is dismissed as
 it is no longer present.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 MR BRAIN WITH CONTRAST:

 COMPARISON:  None.

 HISTORY:  Preoperative planning for left parasagittal meningioma.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiplanar post-contrast imaging of the brain was performed.

 FINDINGS:  Limited post-contrast MRI of the brain demonstrates an enhancing
 left parafalcine lesion measuring approximately 2.1 x 3.3 x 3.5 cm.  This
 lesion is in close proximity to the adjacent sagittal sinus although it does
 not appear to be involving the sinus.  No other abnormal enhancing lesions are
 identified.  There is minimal surrounding edema and no significant mass
 effect.

 IMPRESSION:  Dural-based enhancing lesion arising from the left parafalcine
 region with minimal mass effect and small amount of surrounding edema.  This
 likely represents a meningioma.

 EXAM:  MRI of the brain.

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Patient with brain tumor status post resection.

 TECHNIQUE:  T1 sagittal and axial and FLAIR T2 susceptibility and diffusion
 axial images of the brain were obtained before gadolinium.  T1 axial and MP-
 RAGE sagittal images acquired following gadolinium.  Comparison was made with
 the MRI of [**2157-10-20**].

 FINDINGS:  Since the previous study, the patient has undergone resection of
 left parietal parafalcine extra-axial mass.  Blood products are seen in the
 region with edema.  Air is seen intracranially.  Bilateral small subdural
 collections are seen.  These findings are indicative of post-operative change.
 No acute infarct seen.  No midline shift or hydrocephalus identified.  No
 residual nodular enhancement is identified.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Status post resection of left parietal parafalcine mass with expected
 post-surgical changes of blood products and air in the region and intracranial
 air and bilateral small subdural collections.  No acute infarct, mass effect,
 or hydrocephalus.  No residual nodular enhancement seen.

[**2157-10-21**]: Left craniotomy for mass resection


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 18661**] is a 75yo RHM with CAD s/p CABG, AS, HTN,
Hyperlipidemia, now here for resection of parasagittal
meningioma. Pt first noted symptoms three years ago with
dizziness, was evaluated in [**State 108**] where a head CT revealed L
frontal extraxial mass (~2cm per pt). Seen by a neurosurgeon in
[**State 108**] and told watchful waiting was best. However 6 weeks ago
the patient had an episode where his right lower extremity ""gave
way."" Occasionally ""feels like wood."" He underwent MRI scan
which revealed enlargement of the mass, with descriptions from
records documenting 2.5x3.4x2cm L frontal lobe extraaxial mass,
and also
a much smaller 12mmx8mmx4mm mass in the R temporal lobe (per
[**Hospital3 417**] report). He was started on decadron 1mg [**Hospital1 **].
Pt was scheduled for resection with Dr. [**First Name4 (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **] [**2157-10-22**].
However last night he was moving furniture, and upon moving a
bureau back into his home he developed a sensation of numbness
at his foot that travelled to his upper thigh over the course of
only a few seconds. He then noted rhythmic low amplitude shaking
of the limb that was not suppressable. His right arm then
extended outwards beyond his volitional control. His wife took
him to [**Hospital3 417**] where he was given ativan IV, loaded with
Fosphenytoin 1,000mg IV. The movements subsided in about 15
minutes. No loss of consciousness. No speech/language deficits.
No visual loss. He reports no further episodes since. Currently
feeling well. Denies any headaches. He does still feel a loss of
sensation in a stocking distribution of his right foot to his
ankle. When he walks he feels like he does not have command over
his right leg. No bowel or bladder dysfunction.

-------------------
IMAGING:
-------------------
MRI Head [**10-20**]:
FINDINGS: Limited post-contrast MRI of the brain demonstrates an
enhancing
left parafalcine lesion measuring approximately 2.1 x 3.3 x 3.5
cm. This
lesion is in close proximity to the adjacent sagittal sinus
although it does not appear to be involving the sinus. No other
abnormal enhancing lesions are identified. There is minimal
surrounding edema and no significant mass effect.
IMPRESSION: Dural-based enhancing lesion arising from the left
parafalcine
region with minimal mass effect and small amount of surrounding
edema. This
likely represents a meningioma.

MRI Head [**10-22**](post-op):
FINDINGS: Since the previous study, the patient has undergone
resection of
left parietal parafalcine extra-axial mass. Blood products are
seen in the
region with edema. Air is seen intracranially. Bilateral small
subdural
collections are seen. These findings are indicative of
post-operative change.No acute infarct seen. No midline shift or
hydrocephalus identified. No residual nodular enhancement is
identified.
IMPRESSION:
1. Status post resection of left parietal parafalcine mass with
expected
post-surgical changes of blood products and air in the region
and intracranial air and bilateral small subdural collections.
No acute infarct, mass effect, or hydrocephalus. No residual
nodular enhancement seen.

EEG [**10-20**]:
BACKGROUND: A 9 Hz posterior predominant rhythm was seen in the
brief
waking state.
HYPERVENTILATION: Could not be performed.
INTERMITTENT PHOTIC STIMULATION: Produced no activation of the
record.
SLEEP: The patient progressed from wakefulness to drowsiness but
did
not attain stage II sleep.
CARDIAC MONITOR: Showed a generally regular rhythm with an
average rate
of 60 bpm.
IMPRESSION: This is a normal predominantly drowsy routine EEG in
the
waking and drowsy states. There were no focal lateralize or
epileptiform features.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to the Neurosurgical service on [**10-18**]
following an episode of seizure.  The patient underwent
resection of the left para-sagittal mass on [**10-21**].  He tolerated
this procedure well and remained neurologically unchanged
post-resection.  He was taken to the ICU post-operatively for
close monitoring on POD0.  On POD#1, he was transferred to the
neurosurgical floor. He was subsequently seen and evaluated by
PT and OT and was cleared for discharge home.

GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS
WOUND CARE:
??????	You or a family member should inspect your wound every day and
report any of the following problems to your physician.
??????	Keep your incision clean and dry, you may shower from the neck
down. You will not need to have sutures removed, as Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] has
used dissolvable sutures.
??????	Do NOT apply any lotions, ointments or other products to your
incision.
??????	DO NOT DRIVE until you are seen at the first follow up
appointment.
??????	Do not lift objects over 10 pounds until approved by your
physician.

DIET
Usually no special diet is prescribed after a craniotomy. A
normal well balanced diet is recommended for recovery, and you
should resume any specially prescribed diet you were eating
before your surgery.  Be sure however, to remain well hydrated,
and increase your consumption of fiber, as pain medications may
cause constipation.

MEDICATIONS:
??????	Take all of your medications as ordered.  You do not have to
take pain medication unless it is needed.  It is important that
you are able to cough, breathe deeply, and is comfortable enough
to walk.
??????	Do not use alcohol while taking pain medication.
??????	Medications that may be prescribed include:
-Narcotic pain medication such as Dilaudid (hydromorphone).
	-An over the counter stool softener for constipation (Colace or
Docusate). If you become constipated, try products such as
Dulcolax, Milk of Magnesia, first, and then Magnesium Citrate or
Fleets enema if needed). Often times, pain medication and
anesthesia can cause constipation.
??????	You have been discharged on Keppra (Levetiracetam), you will
not require blood work monitoring.
??????	You were on Aspirin, prior to your surgery. You may restart
this one week after your surgery.
??????	Unless directed by your doctor, do not take any
anti-inflammatory medicines such as Motrin, Aspirin, Advil, and
Ibuprofen etc, as this can increase your chances of bleeding.
??????	You are being sent home on steroid medication taper, make sure
you are taking a medication to protect your stomach (Prilosec,
Protonix, or Pepcid), as these medications can cause stomach
irritation.  Make sure to take your steroid medication with
meals, or a glass of milk.

ACTIVITY:
The first few weeks after you are discharged you may feel tired
or fatigued. This is normal. You should become a little stronger
every day. Activity is the most important measure you can take
to prevent complications and to begin to feel like yourself
again. In general:
??????	Follow the activity instructions given to you by your doctor
and therapist.
??????	Increase your activity slowly; do not do too much because you
are feeling good.
??????	You may resume sexual activity as your tolerance allows.
??????	If you feel light headed or fatigued after increasing
activity, rest, decrease the amount of activity that you do, and
begin building your tolerance to activity more slowly.
??????	DO NOT DRIVE until you speak with your physician.
??????	Do not lift objects over 10 pounds until approved by your
physician.
??????	Avoid any activity that causes you to hold your breath and
push, for example weight lifting, lifting or moving heavy
objects, or straining at stool.
??????	Do your breathing exercises every two hours.
??????	Use your incentive spirometer 10 times every hour, that you
are awake.

WHEN TO CALL YOUR SURGEON:
With any surgery there are risks of complications. Although your
surgery is over, there is the possibility of some of these
complications developing. These complications include:
infection, blood clots, or neurological changes. Call your
Physician Immediately if you Experience:

??????	Confusion, fainting, blacking out, extreme fatigue, memory
loss, or difficulty speaking.
??????	Double, or blurred vision. Loss of vision, either partial or
total.
??????	Hallucinations

??????	Stiff neck, and/or a fever of 101.5F or more.
??????	Severe sensitivity to light. (Photophobia)
??????	Severe headache or change in headache.
??????	Seizure
??????	Problems controlling your bowels or bladder.
??????	Productive cough with yellow or green sputum.
??????	Swelling, redness, or tenderness in your calf or thigh.

Call 911 or go to the Nearest Emergency Room if you Experience:
??????	Sudden difficulty in breathing.
??????	New onset of seizure or change in seizure, or seizure from
which you wake up confused.
??????	A seizure that lasts more than 5 minutes.

Important Instructions Regarding Emergencies and After-Hour
Calls
??????	If you have what you feel is a true emergency at any time,
please present immediately to your local emergency room, where a
doctor there will evaluate you and contact us if needed. Due to
the complexity of neurosurgical procedures and treatment of
neurosurgical problems, effective advice regarding emergency
situations cannot be given over the telephone.
??????	Should you have a situation which is not life-threatening, but
you feel needs addressing before normal office hours or on the
weekend, please present to the local emergency room, where the
physician there will evaluate you and contact us if needed.

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
[**2153-9-3**] Four vessel coronary artery bypass grafting(LIMA to LAD,
SVG to Diagonal, SVG to OM, SVG to PDA)

History of Present Illness:
This is a 71 year old male with known CAD. He underwent PTCA to
LAD and diagonal in [**2145**]. Prior to hernia repair operation, an
ETT in [**2153-7-27**] was notable for EKG changes. An ECHO in [**Month (only) 205**]
[**2153**] was notable for mild MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**Last Name (Titles) 1192**] AS. The [**Location (un) 109**] was
estimated at 1.1 cm2 with peak/mean gradients of 34 and 22 mmHg.
The was mild concentric LVH with an LVEF of 60%. He was
subsequently referred for cardiac catheterization. This was
performed at the [**Hospital1 18**] on [**2153-8-16**]. Angiography showed a right
dominant system with 80% ostial LAD lesion; first diagonal had a
60% stenosis; the circumflex had a 60% lesion while the RCA had
a 40% stenosis. There was only mild AS with [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Location (un) 109**] of 1.8 cm2
and mean gradient of 18mmHg. Left ventriculogram showed
preserved LV function. Based on the above results, he was
referred for CABG.

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted and underwent four vessel CABG on [**2153-9-3**] by
Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]. Surgery was uneventful - see op note for further
details. Following the operation, he was brought to the CSRU in
stable condition. There he was weaned from inotropic support and
was extubated without difficulty. He was noted to have some
ventricular ectopy which improved after intravenous Lidocaine
and PO beta blockade. K and Mg levels were monitored closely and
repleted per protocol. He otherwise maintained stable
hemodynamics. Units of PRBCs were intermittently transfused to
maintain hematocrit close to 30%. On POD 1, he transferred to
the SDU.  He remained in a normal sinus - no further ventricular
ectopy was noted. Beta blockade was slowly advanced as
tolerated. Over several days, he made clinical improvements. By
discharge, he was near his preoperative weight with oxygen
saturations over 96% on room air. He also worked daily with
physical therapy and made steady progress. His hospital course
was otherwise uneventful and he was cleared for discharge to
home on POD 5. He is scheduled to follow up with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **] and
his local cardiologist in approximately 4 weeks.

 MR HEAD WITHOUT AND WITH CONTRAST, [**2158-5-22**]

 HISTORY:  Status post resection of left parafalcine meningioma.

 Sagittal and axial short TR, short TE spin echo imaging was performed through
 the brain.  After administration of 14 ml of Magnevist intravenous contrast,
 axial imaging was performed with [**Last Name (LF) 10754**], [**First Name3 (LF) 4767**] TR, long TE fast spin echo,
 gradient echo, diffusion, and short TR, short TE spin echo technique.
 Sagittal MP-RAGE imaging was performed and reformatted into axial and coronal
 orientations.  Comparison to a brain MR [**First Name (Titles) **] [**2157-10-22**].

 FINDINGS:  There is no evidence of recurrent meningioma.  Again seen are
 postsurgical changes in the left parietal region.  There has been a decrease
 in the edema seen on the [**Year (4 digits) 10754**] images since the prior study.  The small
 bilateral subdural fluid collections present on the prior study have resolved.
 Again seen are foci of increased white matter signal intensity in the
 periventricular and subcortical regions, likely reflecting chronic small
 vessel ischemia.  There is no evidence of other masses or abnormal
 enhancement.  There are no findings to suggest infarction.

 CONCLUSION:  Resolving post-surgical changes with no evidence of tumor
 recurrence.

Brief Hospital Course:
39 yo male with history of GERD admitted with IMI.
.
IMI - His EKG and cardiac enzymes were consistent with IMI. He
has risk factors that included family history and
hypercholesterolemia and tobacco use. He had a stent placed in
the RCA and was given aggrastat post cath for 18 hours. He was
continued on ASA, started on maximum dose statin, beta blocker
and ACE inhibitor, plavix. He should remain on plavix for at
least 6 months. Echo showed preserved EF. He was also counseled
on smoking cessation and diet/nutrition.
.
Hypercholesterolemia - He was started on  maximum dose statin,
80mg atorvastatin. If his triglycerides remain elevated,
gemfibrozil could be added as an outpatient.

Elevated glucose: He may have glucose intolerance. He was
counseled on a low sugar diet and should have this followed up
by his PCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) 61986**] he can be managed with diet control only.

Transaminitis - He likely has NASH given hypercholesterolemia
and obesity; His
hepatitis serologies were pending at time of discharge. His
LFT's should be followed up in 6 weeks with initiation of statin
therapy.

History of Present Illness:
58 yo male with hx type 1 DM on insulin pump, ?vertigo, no known
[**Hospital **] transferred to CCU for management of presumed DKA in the
setting of new EKG changes and borderline enzymes. No previous
CAD history althouth cath in '[**41**] reported to be negative with
subsequent negative stress test. Pt has history of vertigo with
recent flare after fall from slipping on ice. Otherwise, pt was
in USOH until 1 day prior to admission when his insulin pump
fell out at 2am. Pt took some short acting insulin, but no
lantus. Pt developed worsening nausea followed by several
episodes of emesis. Denies chest pain, SOB, diaphoresis. In OSH
[**Name (NI) **], pt was afebrile, hemodynamically stable, but found to have
blood sugar to 555, bicarb 18, anion gap 25, and ABG 7.27/38/73.
EKG was performed which showed diffuse ST depressions in V3-V6,
1, 2, AVF which were new from EKG from [**3-16**]. CPK and Tn were
negative but given DM, he was started on IV heparin and
integrillin and transfered to [**Hospital1 18**] for cath. Per OSH report,
head CT and CXR were negative. Repeat EKG showed decreased ST
depressions with 2nd Tn of 0.11 and CPK 153/MB 12. Recent
increased anion gap closed to 18. Pt remained chest pain free on
transfer to [**Hospital1 18**].

.
old EKG ([**3-16**]): sinus brady @80 with atrial ectopy, low limb
voltage, nl axis/interval, no ST changes

Brief Hospital Course:
1. CAD: Initial EKG showed marked depressions in v3-6. On
admission to the CCU, art line was placed, after which pt was
noted to be bradycardic to the 40s and hypotensive to 70s
according to the art line. Pt was bolused with IVF without
significant increase in BP. Dopamine was started. Pt was
asymptomatic. Pt was taken emergently to the cath lab as we were
concerned about acute ischemia. Pt was found to have diffuse
disease and 60-70% stenosis of LCx. In retrospect, pt's
hypotensive episode was most likely spurious, as the arterial
line BP and cuff pressures did not correlate. Cuff pressures did
not drop below 90s systolic during the entire time. Pt may have
some arterial stenosis which led to spurious BP. By cardiac
enzymes, pt was found to have NSTEMI with peak CK of 573 and
peak Tn of 1.09. Pt was started on Aspirin, Statin, plavix. BB
and ACE were initially held in setting of ""hypotension"", but
then was started. Later, decision was made to perform another
cath and to stent the LCx lesion which was done successfully.

2. DM: Pt was admitted in DKA with AG 17. He was started on
insulin drip and IVF and frequent electrolyte checks/repletions.
Gap was successfully closed. Pt was transitioned to insulin
pump.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: The left atrium is mildly dilated.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: The right atrium is normal in size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated. There is severe
global left ventricular hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: The right ventricular wall thickness is normal. Right
ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function is
normal.

AORTA: The aortic root is normal in diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion.

MITRAL VALVE: The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal.

PERICARDIUM: There is no pericardial effusion.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are
normal. The left ventricular cavity size is top normal/borderline dilated with
an apical aneurysm present. There is severe global left ventricular
hypokinesis. Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed.
Right ventricular chamber size is normal. Right ventricular systolic function
is normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good
leaflet excursion. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Can not
comment on aortic aor mitral valve regurgitation since no doppler studies were
performed.There is no pericardial effusion. There is an echogenic density in
the right ventricle consistent with a pacemaker lead.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of[**2124-6-21**], no
change.

Service:  CCU

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is a 72-year-old male
with coronary artery disease status post myocardial
infarction, CHF with an ejection fraction of 15% and ICD for
DF/VT.  Here for possible ICD malfunction after he was
shocked three times at home the night before admission to an
outside hospital.  The first shock occurred on the morning
prior to admission with no preceding symptoms.  The second
shock occurred while walking downstairs, and he reported
reaching out his arm.  Third shock occurred shortly after
this when he was reaching out with his left hand, and the
final and fourth shock occurred when he was reaching out in
bed with his left arm and received multiple shocks in a row.

At the outside hospital, the patient had a magnet placed over
his ICD, and was given magnesium sulfate.  He was
hemodynamically stable, and had no complaints otherwise.

On review of symptoms, the patient reported occasional
orthostatic hypotension, but denied chest pain, shortness of
breath, nausea, or vomiting.  The patient denies fever or
chills.  Denied bloody stools or black stools.  The patient
denied orthopnea, PND, or dyspnea.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1. Coronary artery disease status post myocardial infarction
and ischemic cardiomyopathy.
2. ICD for VF with second SVC coil because of high DFTs with
three-lead fracture in 03/99.
3. Atrial fibrillation.
4. Chronic renal insufficiency.
5. CHF with an EF of 15%.
6. Hypercholesterolemia.
7. Obesity.
8. History of unsuccessful VT ablation.
9. Osteoarthritis.
10. BPH.
11. Reactive airway disease.
12. Diabetes mellitus type 2.

MEDICATIONS:
1. Toprol 50 b.i.d.
2. Vasotec 10 b.i.d.
3. Lasix 40 b.i.d.
4. Imdur 60 q.d.
5. Lanoxin 125 mcg.
6. Levoxyl 125 mcg.
7. Lipitor 40.
8. Plavix 75.
9. Spironolactone 25.
10. Dofetilide 250 q.d.
11. Coumadin 10 two days a week, 7.5 five days a week.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  Patient reports coronary artery disease in
his father.  [**Name (NI) **] also has a 50 pack year smoking history, but
quit 34 years ago.  He denies alcohol use.

ALLERGIES:  Shellfish and IV dye, which causes hives, and
amiodarone which caused edema.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 97.7, heart rate of
80, blood pressure 86/52, respiratory rate 16.  Saturating
97% on room air.  Patient was alert and oriented times three
in no acute distress.  Neck was supple.  Pupils are equal,
round, and reactive to light.  Clear oropharynx.  There was
no JVD and no carotid bruits.  Cardiovascular reveals
regular, rate, and rhythm with occasional irregular beats.
Faint systolic ejection murmur at the left lower sternal
border.  Respiratory:  Lungs are clear to auscultation
bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender, nondistended.
Extremities revealed trace bilateral lower extremity edema.

SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:
1. Cardiac rhythm:  Patient is admitted with multiple shocks
from his ICD.  The shocks had occurred when the patient was
using his left arm predominantly.  This is likely due to the
fact that there was a device malfunction.  The device was
interrogated, and found to be oversensing noise from certain
arm movements.  The device was turned off and programmed DDD.
The INR was 2.5, so the patient was given vitamin K with plan
for future need revision.

Overnight the patient had a four-second pause on telemetry,
although the patient was asymptomatic.  The patient returned
to the Electrophysiology Laboratory and had a pacing catheter
placed.  The patient was transferred to the CCU on [**2126-5-7**] for further monitoring in the setting of transvenous
pacing.  The patient remained comfortable and when his INR
trended down, he returned to the EP Laboratory for device
revision and lead revision.  Patient tolerated the procedure
well.

After this, the patient returned to the [**Hospital3 **]
floors and received multiple shocks on the morning, which
were appropriate for ventricular tachycardia.  The patient's
pacemaker was interrogated and found to be functioning well.
It was reprogrammed to over pace out of ventricular
tachycardia prior to shocking.  The patient had additional
episodes of ventricular tachycardia, which were successfully
paced out of by his pacemaker.  Patient was started on
lidocaine drip given his significant ventricular tachycardia
and the episodes of VT diminished significantly.  The patient
was transitioned to mexiletine on the next day, and tolerated
this well.  The patient had no further episodes of
significant ventricular tachycardia.

2. Coronary artery disease:  The patient currently had no
symptoms.  He was continued on his Plavix, statin,
beta-blocker, and Imdur.  Patient was not admitted on an
aspirin, although he was given an aspirin during his
hospitalization given the fact that was Coumadin was held.
Plan for no aspirin on discharge with resuming his Coumadin
as per his prior home regimen.

3. Congestive heart failure:  Patient has an ischemic
cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of less than 20%.
An echocardiogram on this hospitalization again revealed an
ejection fraction of 15-20%.  While the patient was NPO
during episodes of this hospitalization, his Lasix and
aldactone was held; however, he was continued on his Lasix,
aldactone, digoxin, and ACE inhibitor.  Patient had no
evidence of congestive heart failure during this
hospitalization and he resumed his prior medications before
discharge.

4. Endocrine:  Patient with hypothyroidism:  The patient was
continued on his Levoxyl.  He was also maintained on a
regular insulin-sliding scale.  Blood sugars remained in
normal levels, and he did not require significant amounts of
insulin.

5. Renal:  Patient with chronic renal insufficiency.
Remained stable throughout this hospitalization.

6. Heme:  Patient's INR was reversed with vitamin K, and the
patient was instructed to resume Coumadin dosing on the
evening following discharge.  The patient will follow up with
his cardiologist or primary care physician for further
monitoring of his INR and adjustment of his Coumadin dose.

7. ID:  The patient had a temperature greater than 101.5
following his pacemaker placement, and therefore was
continued on his cephalosporin, which was originally given
for prophylaxis.  The patient was transitioned to p.o.
antibiotics, plan for seven-day course.

CONDITION ON DISCHARGE:  Stable.

DISCHARGE STATUS:  To home.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. ICD firing.
2. ICD revision.
3. Ventricular tachycardia.

 CHEST, 1 VIEW:

 HISTORY:  Post-op CABG.

 COMPARISON:  [**2177-8-26**]

 This is the immediate post-op film.

 ETT is in good position approximately 3.9 cm above the carina.  The exact
 location of the tip of the Swan-Ganz catheter is obscured by overlying
 hardware.  However, it appears to be in the right atrium and is not in the
 pulmonary artery outflow tract or pulmonary artery.  It should be refloated
 with a repeat chest x-ray performed.  There are two mediastinal tubes in
 adequate position.  There is apparently no chest tube.

 At the base of the left lung is a focal lucency which may represent a small
 pneumomediastinum.  Attention to this region should be paid on the repeat
 film.  There are bands of linear density in the lower third of the left lung
 consistent with atelectasis or infiltrate.

 IMPRESSION:  NG tubes and Swan-Ganz catheter need to be repositioned.  These
 findings were discussed with _________ in the CSRU at 3:20 P.M.

 Question left pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax.  Follow up examination is
 recommended.

 INDICATION:  CAD, evaluate for pneumothorax.

 COMPARISON:  [**2177-9-1**].

 TECHNIQUE:  A single AP portable supine chest.

 FINDINGS:  An endotracheal tube is in place with tip terminating in the upper
 trachea, in satisfactory position.  A right internal jugular sheath and right
 venous access catheter with tip terminating in the distal SVC.  Nasogastric
 tube with tip terminating in the upper stomach.  Two (2) mediastinal drains.
 There is again seen, pneumopericardium, which appears unchanged from the
 previous examination.  The right chest wall is excluded from the radiograph.
 Allowing for this, no definite pneumothorax is visualized.  Left pleural
 effusion.  Linear opacity at the left base, consistent with atelectasis.  Hazy
 interstitial opacities bilaterally, consistent with mild congestive heart
 failure, slightly improved.  The osseous structures appear unchanged.

 IMPRESSION

 1.  Stable appearance of pneumomediastinum/pneumopericardium.  No evidence of
     pneumothorax.

 2.  Left-sided pleural effusion, and slight improvement in congestive heart
 failure.

 3.  Bibasilar atelectasis.

IDENTIFICATION/CHIEF COMPLAINT:  This is a [**Age over 90 **]-year-old male
with a history of coronary artery disease, re-do coronary
artery bypass grafting and hypertension, who presented to an
outside hospital with unstable angina.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease:
    a) The patient had coronary artery bypass grafting with a
saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending artery,
a saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse marginal artery, a
saphenous vein graft to the third obtuse marginal artery and
a saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery.
    b) He had re-do coronary artery bypass grafting in [**2170**]
with a saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending
artery with no bypass grafts to total occlusions of right
coronary artery and obtuse marginal artery grafts.
    c) In [**2172-3-5**], the patient had a stent of the
saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending artery
with a cardiac catheterization showing a left ventricular end
diastolic pressure of 17, an ejection fraction of 42% and mid
inferior akinesis and anterolateral akinesis/hypokinesis.
    d) In [**2172-6-2**], the patient had a percutaneous
transluminal coronary angioplasty of a saphenous vein graft
to the left anterior descending artery with a left
ventricular end diastolic pressure of 19.
2.  Hypercholesterolemia.
3.  Hypertension.
4.  Chronic renal insufficiency with a baseline creatinine of
1.9.
5.  Hernia repair.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:
Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
Enalapril 10 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Metoprolol 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. q.d.
Sublingual nitroglycerin p.r.n.

ALLERGIES:  There were no known drug allergies.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient was doing well post
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in [**2172-6-2**].
On [**2172-10-11**], he developed back pain while sitting.
This involved radiation to his left arm and also some
retrosternal chest pain.  He also described some slight
shortness of breath with nausea and diaphoresis.  This
episode of chest pain was not initially relieved with
sublingual nitroglycerin and the patient presented to [**Hospital6 18075**].

At [**Hospital6 2561**], the patient was found to have no
acute electrocardiogram changes and laboratory investigation
showed a CBC with a white blood cell count of 10.7, a
hematocrit of 36.6, a platelet count of 291 and a Chem 7
which was within normal limits with a BUN of 50 and a
creatinine of 1.9.  His CK, MB and troponin I were noted to
be 64, 2.6 and 0.2.  His second set of enzymes were also
normal.  The patient was admitted and his chest pain was
treated with nitroglycerin and heparin drips.  He was also
noted to have an asymptomatic run of ventricular tachycardia
of 27 beats without any hemodynamic compromise.  The patient
was started on a lidocaine infusion at that time.

The patient was transferred to [**Hospital1 188**] on [**2172-10-14**] and was taken straight to the
cardiac catheterization laboratory.  There, he was found to
have a cardiac output and cardiac index of 3.1 and 1.8
respectively.  His right ventricular end diastolic pressure
was 16 and his pulmonary artery pressures were 48/28 with a
mean of 39.  His wedge pressure was noted to be 29 and his
mixed venous oxygen saturation was 42.  No left ventricular
angiography was done.

Examination of the coronary arteries showed a right dominant
system with a normal left main coronary artery.  There was a
99% lesion at the first obtuse marginal artery and a 100%
lesion at the second obtuse marginal artery.  His
posterolateral ventricular branch was noted to be occluded at
30%.  The right coronary artery, which had a previous known
occlusion, was not injected.  The patient's saphenous vein
graft to left anterior descending artery stent was found to
be 98% occluded and the patient underwent balloon
percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and subsequent
brachytherapy with a residual occlusion of 10%.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient denied any history of tobacco
use.  He consumed alcohol socially and currently lived alone
without support.  The patient was capable of doing his own
shopping, cooking, cleaning and driving.  He did have a
health care proxy by the name of [**Name (NI) 1743**] [**Name (NI) 7049**], who resided
at 74 [**Hospital1 36830**]in [**Hospital1 2436**].

FAMILY HISTORY:  The family history was noncontributory.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination, the patient was in no
apparent distress with vital signs showing a temperature of
96.9??????F, a blood pressure of 138/63, a heart rate of 87, a
respiratory rate of 20 and an oxygen saturation of 96% on a
nonrebreather mask.  The neurological examination was
unremarkable.  The patient was awake, alert and oriented
times three.  On head and neck examination, the pupils were
equal and reactive to light.  The extraocular movements were
intact.  The oropharynx was moist.

On cardiovascular examination, the patient's jugular venous
pressure was 8-10 cm above the sternal angle.  He had a
normal S1 and S2 with an S3 and S4.  He did not have any
audible murmurs.  The respiratory examination showed diffuse
crackles half way up his chest bilaterally with no wheezes.
The abdominal examination was unremarkable.  The extremities
showed palpable bilateral dorsalis pedis pulses with no
edema.  He had a right groin pulmonary artery catheter line
in place and his arterial sheath site was clean, dry and
intact with no bruit or hematoma.

LABORATORY DATA:  The patient's cardiac care unit laboratory
values showed a white blood cell count of 14,200, hematocrit
of 27.6 and platelet count of 211,000.  Chem 7 showed a
sodium of 129, potassium of 4.1, chloride of 97, bicarbonate
of 18, BUN of 46, creatinine of 2.1 and glucose of 217.  CK
was 555, calcium was 9.0 and magnesium was 1.6.   Arterial
blood gases showed a pH of 7.33, a pCO2 of 29 and a pO2 of
90.

ELECTROCARDIOGRAM:  The patient's electrocardiogram on
[**2172-10-12**] showed him to be in sinus rhythm at 60
with a prolonged P-R interval, a normal P wave and a QRS axis
of -60 to -90.  He also had a right bundle branch block with
a left anterior hemiblock.  He had Q waves noted in leads III
and aVF.  He also had some premature ventricular
contractions.  There were T wave inversions in leads V1 to
V4, which appeared unchanged from his electrocardiogram from
[**2172-7-1**].

RADIOLOGY DATA:  The patient's chest x-ray showed significant
pulmonary vascular redistribution cephalad.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  Following cardiac catheterization, the
patient was continued on Plavix and received aggressive
diuresis for his elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.
On [**2172-10-15**], the patient was noted to have
continued runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and an
echocardiogram was done, which showed the patient to have a
moderately depressed left ventricular function with 1+ aortic
insufficiency, 2+ mitral regurgitation and 1+ tricuspid
regurgitation.  He also was noted to have inferior and
inferoseptal hypokinesis.  The pulmonary artery catheter was
removed along with the introducer on that day.

On [**2172-10-16**], the patient was noted to be in atrial
bigeminy in the morning and also continued to have short runs
of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia of three to four
beats.  The patient continued with his intravenous diuresis
with 80 mg of Lasix q.d. and was subsequently transferred to
the floor.  On [**2172-10-17**], the electrophysiology
department was informally consulted and the patient's
metoprolol dose was increased.  The patient's rhythm
continued to be monitored.

On [**2172-10-19**], the patient was in stable condition
with adequate diuresis.  His nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia continued to improve and the patient continued to
show no further episodes of nonsustained ventricular
tachycardia.

The patient was discharged home on [**2172-10-19**] in
stable condition.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
Plavix 75 mg p.o. q.d.
Enteric coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
Lipitor 20 mg p.o. q.d.
Metoprolol 37.5 mg p.o. q.d.
Enalapril 10 mg p.o. q.d.
Amlodipine 5 mg p.o. q.d.
Lasix 40 mg p.o. q.d.
Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d.
Nitroglycerin 0.4 mg sublingual every five minutes p.r.n.
times three.
Protonix 40 mg p.o. q.d.

FOLLOW UP:  The patient was instructed to follow up with his
primary cardiologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 1391**], at [**Hospital3 **] in the
upcoming week.

Sputum perulent with ? pna on CXR; levoflox started.  10mg of lasix given for low u/o.  Wife and two sons in and updated by team.  Need to have family meeting with neurology and SICU teams this week.

Review of Systems:

[**Name (NI) **]  Pt. remains in pentobarbital coma and is unresponsive.  Pupils are equal and nonreactive.  Although, at 1600 right pupil was mildly/sluggishly reactive to light.  Cont EEG q 1 hour for 1min. conts.  Keppra started in addition to Dilantin.  Dilantin level therapeutic today.

[**Name (NI) **]  Pt. intubated on [**8-20**] for airway protection.  Now appears to have new pna (GNR per resp. culture) per CXR and sputum.  Sx'ing q 2 hours for thick, yellow secretions requiring ambuing and lavaging.  Sat's down as low as 90% at times when sx'ing required.  ABGs reflective of hypoxemia with PaO2 66, up to 86 and 98 with increase in PEEP.  Last abg reflective of 700X10 PEEP 10 30%; 7.39/44/98/28. Plateau pressure 24. Plan-  aggressive pulm toilet, starting PO levoflox for pna.

CV-  HR 50's low of 48 during stimulation (sx'ing) MAP 60-65 on Levophed currently increased to 0.09mcg/kg/min.  Lasix 10mg given for low u/o.  Pt. remains edemedous with intact skin.

GI- ABD sl. distended, ? last BM, will persue bowel regimen tom'row if no stool overnoc.  TF increased to goal of 75cc/hr of Promote with fiber.

GU-  U/O dropping to low of 25cc/hr this afternoon.  IVF stopped and given 10mg of lasix with 200+ cc out in the first hour.  CVP 18-20 not accounting for 10 PEEP.  *** NURSING: FYI when charting i/o pls be aware of volume when accepting defaults on careview... unable to enter the correct concentration for Pentobarbital.  You have to manually enter correct volume per hour.

ID-  TMAX 99.0 PO.  Conts on Doxycycline and levoflox added.  CSF viral cx's pending, brain biopsy final results on most specs pending and due back wed.  GNR in sputum from [**8-25**] as mentioned.  Conts on acyclovir for HSV encephalitis.

Social-  Mrs. [**Known lastname 165**] and son in to visit this afternoon followed by another son [**Name (NI) 166**] this afternoon.  Both reporting different information givne from the various members of the consulting teams as well as the SICU team.  this is very concerning and frustrating to the family.  The consulting MDs and SICU TEAM has been very accomodating today and have spoke with each visitor today despite coming in a differnt times.  I think a family meeting with Dr. [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) 167**] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) 168**] (PCP [**Name Initial (PRE) 169**]), Neurology and SICU services present is in order for this week.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Mr. [**Known lastname **] is a 72-year-old
gentleman with a history of Hodgkin's disease was transferred
here from [**Hospital3 **] Hospital because of intractable seizures
and decreased mental status.

He was in his usual state of health, active and playing golf,
until [**8-17**] when he began to become ""confused"" and developed
gait difficulties.  According to the family, Mr. [**Known lastname **] was
behaving in a way that was perceived to be nontypical by family
members. [**Name (NI) **] was also having gait difficulties that were
considered to be mild, according to the family members.

Because of these symptoms, he was evaluated at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital
on [**8-17**]. At that time, a head computed tomography was
reported as normal. He was give a diagnosis of transient ischemic
attacks and was d/c home.

Over the next three days, Mr. [**Known lastname **] problems gradually
worsened.  On [**8-20**], he was at home when he developed a
nonfocal onset of seizure which was later generalized.    He
was transferred to the nearest Emergency Department where he
continued to have generalized seizures.  He was given a
Dilantin load and phenobarbital.  His systolic blood pressure
at that time ranged between 120 and 200s.

A repeat head CT was reported to be normal. Despite the Dilantin
load and the phenobarbiltal, the patient continued to have
clinical seizured. Therefore, he was started on an Ativan drip
and was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit. His Dilantin was
also continued on therapeutic levels.  Despite the Ativan drip
and Dilantin therapeutic levels, Mr. [**Known lastname **] continued to be
unresponsive and had intermittent seizures. The rate of the
Ativan IV infusion was increased and the patient was intubated. A
lumbar puncture was performed on [**8-20**] at [**Hospital3 **] Hospital
and showed normal values.

A MRI with diffusion- weighted imaging showed diffuse
hyperintensity in the cerebral cortex (R > L) and both thalami.

At this point, the patient remained intubated and unresponsive
and was therefore transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for further evaluation and
care.


PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Hodgkin's disease diagnosed in [**2106-4-11**] after
developing a respiratory infection.  This was diagnosed as
nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's disease; stage III-B with
positive [**Doctor Last Name **]-Sternberg cells.  A bone marrow biopsy was done
in [**2106-8-11**] which showed no bone marrow involvement.
2.  Status post chemotherapy with bleomycin, Cytoxan,
vincristine, and procarbazine two years ago.  This had to be
discontinued after three cycles because of interstitial lung
disease and because of myelosuppression with episodes of
neutropenic fever.  Most recent surveillance computed
tomography scan revealed gradual interval progression of
Hodgkin's disease with slightly large mediastinal lymph
nodes.
3.  Borderline hypertension.
4.  Colonic polyps.
5.  Tuberculosis.
6.  Cataracts.
7.  Macular degeneration.

MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Aspirin, Prevacid, and Tylenol.
Ativan drip and Dilantin were started at the outside
hospital.

ALLERGIES:  CEFTIN (causes a rash).

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient was a retired chemistry teacher
and lived in [**Hospital3 **].  He was married with no alcohol or
intravenous drug use.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Family history was noncontributory.

CONCISE SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:

Mr. [**Known lastname **] was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit of [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2107-8-23**]. A repeat LP on admission showed normal cells, glucose
and protein. A CSF sample was also obtained for viral cultures
and different viral and fungal Ab titers (including West Nile
Virus, Arboviruses, HSV, HBVs). Routine cultures for bacterial,
TB and other infectious agents were also normal. Cytology was
normal.

Despite the therapeutic levels of PTN and the IV infusion of
Ativan, electroencephalogram (EEG) on admission showed
epileptiform sharp spike activity suggestive of ongoing
epileptict activity. Therefore, a Penotarbital infusion was
started. The Pentobarbital infusion was titrated to obtain a
burst- suppression pattern on bedside 24 h, EEG monitoring. In
particular, the EEG showed sharp waves complexes every 6 to 10
seconds. Dilantin and Depakote were continued as well. At this
point, pressors were started to compensate to the Pentobarbital-
induced decreased cardiac function.

Mr [**Known lastname **] condition did not improve and another magnetic resonance
imaging examination ([**8-24**]) showed multicentric areas of T2
hyperintensity with more concentration in the right frontal as
well as bilateral thalami. Laboratory studies throughout Mr.
[**Known lastname **] admission included several blood cultures, urine cultures
and extensive toxic metabolic workup. Another LP for
cerebrospinal fluid analysis for infection, toxic metabolic and
cytological analysis was also performed.

In order to better elucidate the underlying pathology. A brain
and meningeal biopsy was performed on [**8-24**] in the right
frontal lobe.

In regards to empiric treatment, after the brain biopsy, the
patient received IV Solu- Medrol and high doses of antibiotics
with broad coverage.  The Infectious Disease team was also
involved in the care of Mr. [**Known lastname **]. All the tests performed on his
tissues and fuids obtained under request of the ID team, had
thus far come back normal.

Brain and meningeal biopsy were remarkable for an meningitic
eosinophilic infiltrates and extensive ischemic cortical neuronal
damage (red neurons). There was no evidence of an infectious
[**Doctor Last Name 360**] on traditional staining and/or on electronic microscopy.

Several attempts in decreasing the dose of Pentobarbital resulted
in an increased epileptiform activity on bedside EEG monitor.

Mr. [**Known lastname **] condition deteriorated even further. He had developed
ileus, and his abdomen was hyperextended.  He had been intubated
throughout his entire stay in the Intensive Care Unit and was
increasingly dependent on ventilatory support.

At this point, the patient's  poor clincal status and prognosis
was thoroughly discussed with his closest family members. After
a family meeting, it was decided that Mr. [**Known lastname **] would no longer
benefit from aggressive support.  Therefore, he was extubated
and expired briefly thereafter.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: The right atrium is mildly dilated.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size, and systolic
function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular wall motion is
normal.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

AORTA: The aortic root is normal in diameter. The ascending aorta is normal in
diameter. The aortic arch is normal in diameter.

AORTIC VALVE: The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not
stenotic. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen.

MITRAL VALVE: The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral
regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.

TRICUSPID VALVE: The tricuspid valve leaflets are normal. Mild tricuspid [1+]
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: The pulmonic valve leaflets appear
structurally normal with physiologic pulmonic regurgitation.

PERICARDIUM: There is no pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Based on [**2102**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations,
the echo findings indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended). Clinical
decisions regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and
echocardiographic data.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity
size, and systolic function are normal (LVEF>55%). Regional left ventricular
wall motion is normal. Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not stenotic.
Mild [1+] aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. There is no mitral valve prolapse.
There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial
effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study of [**5-10**], the severity of aortic
regurgitation has increased, but remains only mild.

Based on [**2102**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings
indicate a moderate risk (prophylaxis recommended). Clinical decisions
regarding the need for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and
echocardiographic data.

 HISTORY: Tracheal stenosis.  S/P resection and reconstruction. Assess for
 pneumothorax.

 PORTABLE AP CHEST:  This is a technically limited study, secondary to
 inability to move and properly position the patient.  There is also motion
 artifact.  Note that a significant portion of the left lateral hemithorax is
 not included.

 An ET tube appears to be in satisfactory position.  The mediastinum is
 prominent, which may be related to the patient's recent surgical procedure and
 AP view of this film.  The cardiac silhouette is prominent.  There appears to
 be left lower lobe collapse/consolidation.  There is right basilar
 atelectasis.

 IMPRESSION;  Limited study.  Prominent mediastinum, which may be secondary to
 patient positioning and recent surgical procedure.  No evidence of
 pneumothorax.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PORTABLE CHEST:

 Compared to 2 days earlier.

 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Oxygen desaturation, status post tracheal surgery.

 The examination is somewhat limited due to flexion of the patient's neck,
 resulting in obscuration of the lung apices.  A portion of the left lung has
 also been excluded from the study laterally.

 There is stable widening of the mediastinum.  The heart is upper limits of
 normal in size for portable supine technique.  The pulmonary vascularity is
 distinct compared to previously hazy appearance.  There has also been improved
 aeration in the left lower lobe.  There is probably a left pleural effusion
 and some residual atelectasis.

 IMPRESSION:
 1)  Interval resolution of mild heart failure pattern.
 2)  Improving aeration in the left lower lobe, with residual opacity which
 likely reflects atelectasis and effusion.

Date of Birth:   [**2124-9-29**]     Sex:  M

Service:  Thoracic Surgery

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Tracheal stenosis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 45-year-old
male with a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
and obstructive sleep apnea who underwent uvulopalatotectomy
in [**2165**].  This was complicated by hemorrhage and a
tracheostomy for a period of two weeks.

Subsequently, he has had multiple dilatations for the
tracheal stenosis.  He is now here for tracheal
reconstruction.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
 1.  Obstructive sleep apnea, status post uvulopalatotectomy.
 2.  Tracheostomy for two weeks in [**2165**].
 3.  Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
 4.  Hypertension.
 5.  Atrial fibrillation.  The patient has failed several
direct cardioversions.
 6.  Alcohol abuse.
 7.  History of cardiac catheterization in [**2169-6-28**]
with an ejection fraction of 69% and clean coronaries.
 8.  Kidney stones.
 9.  Umbilical hernia.
10.  Gastroesophageal reflux disease.

p.o. q.d., Coumadin (which has been held).

ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN.

HOSPITAL COURSE:  The patient underwent a rigid bronchoscopy
and direct laryngoscopy, tracheal resection and
reconstruction on [**2170-4-4**].  His intraoperative course was
uneventful.  He was admitted to the Intensive Care Unit
postoperatively in an intubated condition.  He remained
intubated overnight and was in a stable condition.

He was extubated on postoperative day one.  He remained in
atrial fibrillation at this time.  He was started on a
diltiazem drip for the atrial fibrillation with a rate
of 150s.  He underwent a bronchoscopy which showed mild
anastomotic edema and was therefore continued on diuresis.
He remained in the Intensive Care Unit for the next few days
slowly improving with aggressive respiratory treatment.  His
Coumadin was restarted on postoperative day three.  He was
continued on antibiotics of vancomycin and Flagyl which had
been started in the initial postoperative period.

On postoperative day six, he complained of some left lower
extremity pain.  He underwent a lower extremity noninvasive
study which revealed a left lower extremity deep venous
thrombosis.  At this point, he was started on Lovenox as he
was not yet therapeutic on his Coumadin.

On [**2170-4-10**], he underwent another bronchoscopy which
again revealed mucosal edema at the anastomotic site.  In the
next few days in the Intensive Care Unit were essentially
uneventful as he slowly improved, and his respiratory
function was slowly improving.

He was deemed ready for transfer to the regular floor on
postoperative day eight.  He was stable on the floor over the
next few days.  His Coumadin was continued until it reached a
therapeutic level, and at that point the Lovenox was stopped.
He continued to have left leg pain secondary to the deep
venous thrombosis and was treated with a morphine
patient-controlled analgesia.  He had aggressive respiratory
toilet as well at this point.  His clinical condition slowly
improved, and he started ambulating, and his respiratory
function improved as well.

On postoperative day 16 ([**2170-4-20**]), he went back to the
operating room for a bronchoscopy.  At that time, his airways
were clean, and there was no mucosal edema.  He was now ready
for discharge home on Coumadin.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 CT AIRWAY, [**2170-3-22**]:  Compared to [**2170-1-29**].

 CLINICAL INDICATION:  Tracheal stenosis due to prior tracheostomy.

 Helical CT of the thorax was performed with standard dose at end inspiration,
 without IV or oral contrast administration.  A low dose dynamic/expiratory CT
 scan was also performed.

 Additional multiplanar and 3D reconstruction images will be performed from the
 original CT data set and an addendum will be issued once those images become
 available.

 Again demonstrated is a focal area of tracheal stenosis which is located at
 the level of the thyroid gland, and probably relates to complication of
 previous tracheostomy.  The coronal narrowing of the trachea at this site
 appears stable in appearance as compared to the previous examination allowing
 for differences in respiration.  Minimal coronal dimension is approximately 9
 mm.  Below this level, the trachea and main bronchi are normal in size and
 configuration.

 On dynamic expiratory scanning, there is evidence of tracheobronchomalacia.
 The area of tracheal stenosis becomes more markedly narrowed during
 expiration, with reduction in coronal dimension to 5 mm and reduction in AP
 dimension to approximately 7 mm (the latter is approximately 17 mm at end
 inspiration).  Below the level of the stenosis, note is made of excessive
 collapse of the airway at the level of the carina and main stem bronchi with
 the right main stem bronchus affected to a much greater degree than the left.
 The malacia extends into the right upper lobe bronchus and right upper lobe
 segmental bronchi as well as into the bronchus intermedius.  The lungs reveal
 heterogeneous attenuation during expiratory phase of respiration, a frequent
 finding in patients with bronchomalacia.

 The soft tissue structures of the thorax reveal numerous small mediastinal
 lymph nodes which do not meet strict CT criteria for abnormal enlargement. The
 heart size is normal, and coronary artery calcifications are noted.  No
 pericardial or pleural effusions are identified.

 Imaging of the upper portion of the abdomen demonstrates no significant
 abnormality within the imaged portion of the liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys,
                                                             (Over)

 (Cont)
 or adrenal glands, but these organs are incompletely imaged on this study.

 Assessment of the lungs on the standard dose portion of the scan reveals
 linear opacities in both lower lobes, likely reflecting discoid atelectasis
 and/or focal scarring.  No obstructing central endobronchial lesions are seen.
 There is minimal emphysema at the lung apices.

 The skeletal structures of the thorax demonstrate degenerative changes within
 the spine.

 IMPRESSION:
 1)  No significant interval change in focal tracheal stenosis corresponding to
 previous tracheostomy site.  Of note, there is more marked narrowing of this
 area during expiration, suggesting a component of malacia.
 2)  Tracheobronchomalacia below the level of the stenosis, most advanced
 involving the right main stem bronchus, right upper lobe bronchus, and
 bronchus intermedius.
 3)  Minimal emphysema.

 ADDENDUM:  CT AIRWAY STUDY:  Multiplanar and 3D internal and external
 renderings of the airway were performed and are reviewed in conjunction with
 the axial CT images.  These images confirm the presence of mild focal tracheal
 stenosis at the level of the thyroid gland, which becomes accenuated upon
 expiratory imaging.  These images also confirm the presence of
 tracheobronchomalacia as detailed in the report above.

 evidence of marked emphysema.  There is a spiculated noncalcified pulmonary
 nodule within the left lung apex measuring 1.0 x 0.9 cm. There is no evidence
 of pulmonary parenchymal consolidation, pneumothorax, or pleural effusion. The
 heart, pericardium, and great vessels are within normal limits. There is a
 small axial hiatal hernia.

 CT ABDOMEN WITH CONTRAST: The liver, gallbladder, and adrenals are within
 normal limits. There is an absent spleen.  The pancreas is atrophic. There is
 a nonspecific rounded lesion with peripheral calcification near the tail of
 the pancreas. There is evidence of nonspecific mild stranding surrounding both
 kidneys in the perirenal spaces. Both kidneys enhance symmetrically with no
 evidence of renal mass or hydronephrosis.  There are multiple bilateral
 prominent parapelvic cysts.  There is a calcified abdominal aorta. The
 proximal celiac axis and SMA are patent. There is no abnormal dilatation or
 wall thickening within large and small bowel. There is no free air, free fluid
 or intra abdominal abscess.  There are multiple small mesenteric lymph nodes
 none of which reach pathologic size by CT criteria.

 CT PELVIS WITH CONTRAST: There is a Foley catheter within a collapsed urinary
 bladder  with wall thickening. The prostate gland is prominent.  The rectum is
 within normal limits. There is no evidence of inflammatory change in the right
 lower quadrant of the abdomen to suggest appendicitis.

 IMPRESSION:

 1) Nonspecific fat stranding surrounding both kidneys which are otherwise
 within normal limits.

 2) Marked emphysema.

 3) Spiculated noncalcified pulmonary nodule measuring 1 cm within the left
 lung apex.  Although this could prepresent infection, this finding is
 worrisome for neoplasm and requires further evaluation.

 4) Nonspecific cystic lesion within the tail of the pancreas with peripheral
 calcification measuring 1.7 x 1.3 cm. Please note that the patient had a
 resection of the tail of the pancreas for a serous cystadenoma in the past.
 This could represent a post surgical collection or a second focus of disease.

 5) Bladder wall thickening.  In the absence of a positive urinalysis, this
 could reflect the sequelae of long standing prostate hypertrophy.

INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: The left atrium is normal in size.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: The right atrium is normal in size.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left
ventricular cavity size is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function
is normal (LVEF>55%).

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are
normal.

AORTIC VALVE: The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not
stenotic. No aortic regurgitation is seen.

MITRAL VALVE: The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. There is mild mitral annular calcification. There is
mild thickening of the mitral valve chordae. The tips of the papillary muscles
are calcified. There is no significant mitral stenosis. Trivial mitral

Service:

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Patient is an 82-year-old man
without a past medical history except for longstanding
asthma, who presents to the Emergency Department after having
seen his primary care this morning, and noted to have a
temperature of 103 F.  Patient reports that he was in his
usual state of health last evening, however, but he awoke
this morning feeling generally unwell and subsequently had an
episode of nausea and vomiting with subjective fevers.
Patient denies chills.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Positive for chronic nonproductive cough.
Negative for pleuritic chest pain, abdominal pain, dysuria,
or frequency, diarrhea, or hematochezia.  He denies sick
contacts or travel history.  He has had no hospitalizations
since [**2112**] at which time he had resection of a distal
pancreatic mass and splenectomy.

In the Emergency Department, the patient's temperature was
101.6 with stable vital signs.

PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION:  Temperature 101.6, blood
pressure 126/42, heart rate 67, respirations 18, and
saturating 96% on room air.  Generally, the patient was in no
acute distress.  HEENT exam was unremarkable.  He had no
lymphadenopathy in the cervical or axillary regions.  Heart
sounds were normal.  Lung exam was significant for coarse
breath sounds.  Abdomen was benign.  Extremities:  He had
trace to +1 edema bilaterally.

LABORATORIES ON ADMISSION:  White blood cell count 33.5 with
81% neutrophils, 12% bands, 6% lymphocytes, hematocrit 42.8,
platelets 545.  Chem-7 was unremarkable.  Lactate was 4.4.
Urinalysis was negative.

Chest x-ray:  Negative for consolidation or effusion.

Blood cultures:  Negative.

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE:  Patient was admitted to
the Medical Intensive Care Unit according to the MUST sepsis
protocol.  No infectious source was found.  Patient's white
blood cell count continued to trend down on ceftriaxone,
which he was continued on for five days after which point he
was changed to oral Levaquin for a total of 14-day course.
Despite the diagnosis of fever of unknown origin, suspicion
for endocarditis was extremely low, and transthoracic
echocardiogram was also negative for vegetation.  Patient
became afebrile two days after admission and continued to be
afebrile throughout his hospital course.

Lung nodule:  CT torso was done to evaluate potential
abscesses, which could be the source of the patient's fever.
Incidentally, it was noted that patient had a spiculated
noncalcified pulmonary nodule measuring 1 cm in diameter from
the left lung apex.  CT Surgery consulted during this
admission, and recommended a repeat CT scan in one month with
outpatient followup.

Asthma/emphysema:  Patient was continued on his Flovent and
Serevent.  He has no record of pulmonary function tests and
this will be done as an outpatient.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1. Sepsis, fever of unknown origin.
2. Pulmonary nodule seen incidentally on CAT scan.

FOLLOW-UP INSTRUCTIONS:  Patient was instructed to followup
with his primary care doctor, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2903**] in one week.  He was
also instructed to have a repeat CAT scan on his chest in one
month and this was scheduled for [**2117-1-26**].  He is
also to followup with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 175**], Cardiothoracic Surgery
after this CT scan.  Lastly, he is to followup to get
pulmonary function tests on [**1-20**].

DISCHARGE CONDITION:  Stable.  Patient was afebrile and
clinically at his baseline.

DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS:
1. Serevent 50 mcg one inhalation p.o. q.12h.
2. Flovent two puffs b.i.d.
3. Levofloxacin 500 mg one p.o. q.d. for eight days to
complete a 14-day course.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 HISTORY:  82 year-old with a 1 cm spiculated left upper lung nodule.  The
 patient has a history of COPD but no constitutional symptoms.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiple helically acquired axial images were obtained from the
 cherst without intravenous contrast.

 COMPARISON:  CT chest [**2117-1-26**].

 CT CHEST WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  The 7 mm opacity seen in the left lung apex has
 not changed significant in size but does have a larger central cavity.  There
 are numerous other small nodules in both lungs which have not changed in size.
 In the right lung base, there is a nodular area of scarring which has not
 changed.  There is an area of ground-glass and linear opacities seen in the
 right upper lung which is unchanged.  There are no new nodules or
 consolidations.  The airways are patent to the level of the segmental bronchi
 bilaterally.

 On soft tissue windows there has been no change in the size of the small
 mediastinal nodes.  There is no significant axillary lymphadenopathy. The
 heart, pericardium, and great vessels are unremarkable.  There is no
 pericardial or pleural effusion.  The left retroareolar fat tissue density is
 unchanged and most likely represents gynecomastia.

 There is a small hiatal hernia. There is diffuse vascular calcifications seen
 in the visualized portion of the upper abdomen.  The upper abdomen on this
 noncontrast study is otherwise unremarkable.  There are no suspicious lesions
 on bone windows.

 IMPRESSION:  1)  The left upper lobe nodule has cavitated.  Findings
 are concerning for reactivation tuberculosis.  Other considerations would be a
 neoplastic process (small squamous cell lung cancer), fungal infection, or
 vasculitis.

 2)  No significant change in the small mediastinal node or in the small
 pulmonary nodules.

 INDICATION:  COPD, lung nodule seen on scan performed [**2116-12-23**].
 COMPARISON:  [**2116-12-23**], [**2117-1-26**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Noncontrast images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to the
 upper abdomen.

 CHEST CT WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The 7 mm nodular opacity within the
 left lung apex no longer demonstrates a central cavity.  There is a new 14 mm
 x 10 mm cavitary nodule within the posterior segment of the right upper lobe.
 There are no areas of consolidation.  Nodular scarring is present within the
 lung bases bilaterally, unchanged.  There is moderate diffuse emphysema. There
 are no pericardial or pleural effusions.  Again demonstrated are small,
 nonpathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes.  The appearance is
 unchanged compared with the prior study.  The heart and great vessels are
 unremarkable.  There is no significant axillary or hilar lymphadenopathy.

 In the visualized portion of the upper abdomen, no focal abnormalities are
 detected.  There are no suspicious osseous lesions.

 IMPRESSION:  New cavitary nodule within the right upper lobe.  The left upper
 lobe nodule no longer demonstrates central cavitation.  The short term
 development of the right upper lobe nodule is most suggestive of an infectious
 process such as reactivation TB or fungal infection.  A neoplastic process
 cannot be entirely excluded.

 INDICATION:  History of mycobacterial infection, presenting for reassessment
 of pulmonary nodules.

 TECHNIQUE:  Helical axial images of the chest were obtained without
 intravenous contrast.  Thin slice reformatted images were obtained.

 COMPARISON:  [**2117-5-6**] chest CT.

 CHEST CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There are small axillary and mediastinal lymph
 nodes which do not meet criteria for pathologic enlargement and are not
 significantly changed in the interval.  The heart is not enlarged.  Scattered
 aortic calcifications are present.

 The prior seen cavitary lesion in the right upper lobe has largely resolved,
 with minimal residual ground glass opacity.  A linear, 1 cm x 0.3 cm, opacity
 is present at the left lung apex and is stable from the prior study. There is
 evidence of surrounding architectural distortion. Stable diffuse emphysematous
 changes are present. There are scattered faint peripheral ground glass
 opacities in the lingula and along the dependent portion of the right lower
 lobe.  These are not significantly changed in the interval.  A subcentimeter
 pleural-based nodule is present in the left lower lobe and is stable from the
 prior study. Scattered linear scarring is present at both lung bases.  There
 is a stable short band-like opacity in the right lung base which is also
 likely consistent with scarring. A faint nodular opacity is present within the
 upper left major fissure.  This is unchanged from the prior study. Scattered
 stable linear opacities are present at the right lung apex. Several pleural-
 based nodular densities are present in the right middle lobe and are stable in
 the interval. There is a subcentimeter calcified granuloma in the right middle
 lobe adjacent to the diaphragmatic surface.

 The osseous structures reveal moderate degenerative changes.  No suspicious
 lytic or sclerotic lesions are present.  Multiple small left renal parapelvic
 cysts are present.  A 1.3 cm peripherally calcified rounded lesion is present
 immediately posterior to the pancreas.  This is stable from the prior study
 and mayh be a small hematoma secondary to prior splenectomy/distal
 pancreatectomy.  The infrarenal abdominal aorta is ectatic and calcified,
 measuring up to 2.5 cm in diameter.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Bilateral small pulmonary nodular densities, stable from [**2117-5-6**].
 2.  Stable bilateral lower lobe scarring.
 3.  Near complete resolution of prior seen right upper lobe cavitary lung
 nodule.  Residual faint ground glass opacity is present.  No new pulmonary

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  85-year-old man, evaluate for aortic calcification.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT acquired contiguous axial images were obtained from the
 thoracic inlet to the pubic symphysis.  Multiplanar reconstructions were
 performed.

 CONTRAST:  100 cc of IV Optiray contrast were administered due to the rapid
 rate of bolus injection required for this study.

 CTA OF THE CHEST:  No filling defects or pulmonary emboli are identified
 within the pulmonary arteries to the level of the subsegmental branches. There
 is extensive aortic calcification along the aortic arch, which is ectatic in
 appearance.  Additionally, the superior portion of the aorta in the abdomen is
 dilated, measuring 4.6 x 4.5 cm ( series  3, image 95).  There is no evidence
 of aortic dissection.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  The soft tissue window images demonstrate
 bilateral simple appearing pleural effusions.  This is associated adjacent
 compressive atelectasis.  Additionally, there is diffuse ground glass opacity
 adjacent to this, with intralobular septal thickening, consistent with changes
 from pulmonary edema.  Scattered mediastinal lymph nodes are noted, without
 any evidence of pathologic enlargement.  Coronary artery calcifications are
 noted.  No pulmonary nodules or focal parenchymal consolidation is seen.

 There is limited evaluation of the superior portion of the abdomen, and the
 visualized portions of the liver, spleen, and stomach within normal limits.

 BONE WINDOWS:  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic lesions identified.  Extensive
 degenerative changes are seen within the thoracic spine.

 CT RECONSTRUCTIONS:  Multiplanar reconstructions were essential in delineating
 the anatomy and pathology.

 IMPRESSION:
 1)  No evidence of pulmonary embolus.
 2)  Bilateral pleural effusions with adjacent atelectasis.  Findings
 consistent with associated moderate pulmonary edema.
 3)  Extensive aortic calcification.  There is focal upper abdominal aortic

 INDICATION:  CAD, Coumadin, temporal pacemaker wire.

 COMPARISON:  [**2191-2-23**].

 FINDINGS:

 As compared to the previous radiograph, the external pacemaker is no longer
 coiled within the superior SVC.  The wire shows a hook-like configuration in
 the SVC.  There is no evidence of complications, notably no pneumothorax.

 Newly placed nasogastric tube with a course widely deviated from the midline.
 However, the course does not indicate airway intubation.  The tube must be
 advanced, given that the sidehole is located at the level of the middle third
 of the esophagus.

 Unchanged cardiomegaly with evidence of moderate pulmonary edema.  No pleural
 effusions.  No newly occurred focal parenchymal opacity suggesting pneumonia.

 The endotracheal tube is still located very high, its tip projects at the
 level of the clavicles.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 66794**] is an 89 year old gentleman with a history of
atrial fibrillation on amiodarone and coumadin, CAD with 3VD
seen on cardiac cath in [**2186**], CHF with EF of 20%, who initially
presented to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] last night complaining of a slow heart
beat.  Per his wife at around midnight last night he came to bed
complaining that his heart was beating very slowly, he felt weak
and that he could ""feel it in his chest.""  At that time he asked
his wife to call 911 and he was taken to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] for further
evaluation.  Per his wife he did not complain of any chest pain,
shortness of breath or nausea.  Also, the family notes that he
has been having some falls/syncope at home including one event
that he did not remember in the past few weeks.
.
Per EMS report he was found to be pale, cool and diaphoretic on
initial examination.  There he experienced some nausea, vomited
once, appropriate but lethargic, he was found to be bradycardic
to the 20's to 30's and was taken to [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**].  En route to
[**Location (un) 620**] he was given atropine 0.5mg x 2 with no effect, he was
put on external pacing with electrical but not mechanical
capture.  At [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] he was still bradycardic initially to
the 20's, was given atropine 1mg x 2, a right cordis was placed
and pacing wires were floated but kinked and were unable to
capture.  His CK was 87, CK-MB was 2.1.  He was then intubated
for reported AMS, external pacing was again attempted but there
was no mechanical capture.  Throughout his course he was never
hypotensive with his episodes of bradycardia.  EKG's done at [**Hospital1 **]
[**Location (un) 620**] showed at times a junctional rhythm, ventricular escape
and then bradycardia with his old LBBB.  He was then transferred
to [**Hospital1 18**] for further management.
.
On arrival to the [**Hospital1 18**] ER his initial VS were: 96.8, 63,
113/60, 99% on 14x450, 5 PEEP, FiO2 of 100%.  His heart rate
remained in the 50's, he was given fentanyl/versed for sedation,
an OGT was placed and he was transferred to the CCU.  VS on
transfer were: 96, 51, 124/59, 97% on the above ventilator
settings.  His CK was 88, CK-MB was 4 with a troponin of 0.04.
On arrival to the CCU his initial VS were: 97, 43, 130/57, 22,
100% on AC 14x450, PEEP of 5, FiO2 of 60%.  He is currently
intubated and sedated, unable to respond to any questions, he is
moving his extremities.

Brief Hospital Course:
HOSPITAL COURSE:
Mr. [**Known lastname 66794**] is an 89 year old gentleman with a history of
atrial fibrillation on amiodarone/coumadin, CAD with 3VD, CHF
with EF of 20% who presented with symptomatic bradycardia.  He
was transferred to [**Hospital1 18**] for permanenet pacemaker placement.
Hospital course complicated by brief intubation for altered
mental status.
.
# RHYTHM / BRADYCARDIA: Review of EKGs prior to admission reveal
sinus arrest after a junctional rhythm and subsequent
ventricular escape.  When he returned into sinus rhythm he had a
wider QRS interval and prolonged PR interval of 300 ms thank on
prior EKGs.  Etiology unclear, may be secondary to conversion
pause or a toxic or metabolic condition pre-empting sinus arrest
with long PR and wide QRS.  A free T4 was normal. The patient's
home dose of amiodarone was held with concern for toxicity.  A
temporary pacemaker was placed and noted to be coiled in the IVC
and was thus subsequently removed.  Coumadin was held in
anticipation of pacemaker placement.  A permanent pacemaker was
placed on HD 2.  Although the patient is a given EF of 20%
candidate for biventricular ICD placement, dicussion with the
patient and primary cardiologist prompted placement of pacemaker
only, to place the simplest device that would address his
bradycardia. Coumadin was restarted post procedure at his home
regimen, with follow-up at the [**Hospital1 **] [**Location (un) 620**] coumadin clinic.
.
# CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE:  The patient has a history of three
vessel disease and was not on a statin or beta blocker as an
outpatient.  He was started on atorvastatin 80mg daily, aspirin
325 mg daily.  His cardiac enzymes were cycled and flat.  Lipid
panel revealed an LDL of 105, HDL of 33 and total cholesterol of
173, the atorvastatin was discontinued at the time of discharge.

admission demonstrated EF of 20%. An echo on admission was
similar demonstrating more dysynchronous LV function. The
patient was continued on lisinopril at his outpatient dose of
5mg daily.
.
# HYPERTENSION: All antihypertensive medications were held given
bradycardia, and then restarted after pacemaker placement, he
was discharged on his home regimen.
.
# HYPOTHYROID:  The patient was continued on home synthroid at
225mcg daily.  Free T4 was normal with elevation of TSH.  He was
dischargard on his home dose with outpatient PCP follow up for
further titration of his synthroid.

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Mr. [**Known lastname 66794**],

You were recently admitted to the Cardiac Intesive Care Unit for
a low heart rate, which made you feel ill. You presented
intubated (tube in your lungs helping you breathe), which was
quickly taken out. You had a pacemaker placed to help keep your
heart rate within a normal range. You tolerated this procedure
well.
.
In the hospital we found that your thyroid is not working
properly. For this reason your thyroid medication (Synthroid)
may need to be adjusted. Please remember to take this medication
daily and follow up with your Primary Care Physician to address
this.
.
We are making a few changes to your outpatient medications:
-Please START Keflex 500mg by mouth every 8 hours for the next
three days
-Please START Tramadol 25mg by mouth every 6hrs as needed for
pain
***This can cause drowsiness, do not take this medication when
doing activity.
-Please continue to take your Coumadin at the same dose (5mg
every day except for 2.5mg on Monday on Friday). We spoke with
the [**Hospital3 **] at [**Location (un) 620**]. Please have your labs
drawn on Tuesday [**2191-3-1**] for PT/INR. They will adjust your dose
as needed.
.
-Please continue to take your other medications as instructed

Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2186-7-19**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA. No LA mass/thrombus (best excluded by TEE).

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Mildly dilated RA. Increased IVC diameter
(>2.1cm) with <35% decrease during respiration (estimated RAP (10-20mmHg).

LEFT VENTRICLE: Normal LV wall thickness. Moderately dilated LV cavity. Severe
global LV hypokinesis. No LV mass/thrombus. TDI E/e' >15, suggesting
PCWP>18mmHg. No resting LVOT gradient.

LV WALL MOTION: Regional LV wall motion abnormalities include: basal inferior
- akinetic; mid inferior - akinetic; basal inferolateral - akinetic; mid
inferolateral - akinetic; inferior apex - akinetic;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size. Moderate global RV free wall
hypokinesis.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets. Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. Mild mitral
annular calcification. Calcified tips of papillary muscles. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR. Moderate PA
systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Normal pulmonic valve leaflets. Significant
PR.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Echocardiographic results were reviewed by telephone with
the houseofficer caring for the patient.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. No left atrial mass/thrombus seen (best excluded
by transesophageal echocardiography). The estimated right atrial pressure is
10-20mmHg. Left ventricular wall thicknesses are normal. The left ventricular
cavity is moderately dilated with severe global hypokinesis and
inferior/inferolateral akinesis (LVEF = 20-25 %). No masses or thrombi are
seen in the left ventricle. Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left
ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size is
normal with moderate global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets
are mildly thickened. No aortic valve stenosis is suggested. Trace aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is
mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. Significant pulmonic
regurgitation is seen. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2186-7-19**], left ventricular
systolic function has deteriorated, increased LVEDP is now suggested, right
ventricular free wall hyypokinesis is now present, mild mitral regurgitation
and mild-moderate pulmonary artery systolic is now present. The rhythm is now
atrial fibrillation.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
Based on [**2187**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings
indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical decisions regarding the need
for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.

 INDICATION:  89-year-old man with MVC.

 COMPARISON:  CT of the chest with contrast [**2186-7-18**].

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT helical images were acquired through the chest, abdomen, and
 pelvis after administration of 130 cc Optiray intravenous contrast.  Sagittal
 and coronal reformats were generated and reviewed.

 FINDINGS:

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  There is aneurysmal dilation of
 the ascending thoracic aorta, maximally measuring 4.8 cm, similar to the prior
 study 4.6 cm.  No acute aortic injury is detected.  The heart is moderately
 enlarged, with extensive coronary arterial calcifications.  There is no
 pericardial effusion.  A left chest wall pacemaker with the single lead in the
 right ventricle is noted.

 The major airways are patent to subsegmental levels.  A small amount of
 secretions are seen within the right main bronchus and distal trachea. No
 traumatic injury is identified in the lungs.  Bilateral dependent ground glass
 opacification and septal thickening,  likely relates to chronic pulmonary
 edema.  Bilateral trace pleural effusions are simple.  No pneumothorax is
 seen.  No significant mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy is
 detected.  The main pulmonary artery is enlarged, measuring 3.4 cm, suggestive
 of pulmonary arterial hypertension.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITH INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST:  The liver, spleen, adrenal
 glands, pancreas enhance normally, without evidence of acute traumatic injury.
 Multiple small gallstones are seen within a mildly distended gallbladder.
 Both kidneys enhance and excrete contrast symmetrically without hydronephrosis
 or traumatic injury.

 The stomach, small and large bowel are normal, without evidence of acute
                                                             (Over)

Conclusions:
The left atrium is elongated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated. There is moderate regional left ventricular systolic
dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the inferolateral, inferior and septal
walls, apex, and distal anterior wall. The remaining segments contract well
(LVEF 25%). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). No masses
or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. There is no left ventricular
outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. The right ventricular cavity is
moderately dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. The aortic
root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic arch and descending
thoracic aorta are mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly
thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. Trace aortic regurgitation is
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral
regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.
There is no pericardial effusion.

IMPRESSION: Left ventricular cavity enlargement with extensive regional
systolic dysfunction c/w multivessel CAD or other diffuse process. Pulmonary
artery hypertension. Dilated thoracic aorta.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2191-2-23**], the severity
mitral regurgitation is now reduced (may be due to technical differences) and
the estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is slightly higher. Left
ventricular systolic function is similar.

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS:
The left ventricular ejection fraction is <40%, a threshold for which the
patient may benefit from a beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor or [**Last Name (un) 17**].
Based on [**2187**] AHA endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations, the echo findings
indicate prophylaxis is NOT recommended. Clinical decisions regarding the need
for prophylaxis should be based on clinical and echocardiographic data.

 unchanged since the prior study, with mild grade 1 anterolisthesis of C5 on
 C6.  Extensive degenerative changes are seen in the cervical spine, with
 significant multilevel disc height reduction, anterior and posterior
 osteophyte formation and C3-C5 vertebral bodies fusion.  The prevertebral soft
 tissues are normal.  Extensive bilateral carotid calcification at the
 bifurcation is redemonstrated.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Previously noted transverse process fracture of C4 vertebra, is difficult
 to visualize in the radiograph.

 2.  Extensive degenerative changes of the cervical spine, with mild grade 1
 anterolisthesis of C5 on C6.  No significant interval change since prior
 study.

 INDICATION:  Cough and shortness of breath, evaluation for interval changes.

 COMPARISON:  [**2191-2-25**].

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, the patient now presents
 with bilateral moderate pleural effusions, better seen on the lateral than on
 the frontal radiograph.  In addition, there is a platelike atelectasis in the
 middle lobe with subsequent volume loss of the middle lobe and deviation of
 the minor fissure.  The size of the cardiac silhouette is moderately enlarged,
 with marked tortuosity of the thoracic aorta.  Minimal interstitial markings,
 suggesting mild interstitial fluid overload.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 LOWER EXTREMITY ARTERIAL EXAMINATION

 CLINICAL INFORMATION:  Left heel ulcer.

 ABIs, Doppler waveforms and PVRs were obtained bilaterally at rest.  ABI's:
 right PT 1.09, DP 1.19, left PT 0.94, DP 0.89.

 Doppler waveforms demonstrate triphasic flow to the level of the popliteals on
 both sides but monophasic flow below this along the infrapopliteal/tibial
 regions.  Segmental pressures are helpful as the femoral pressures are
 artificially high and do not match with the brachial pressures.  Pulse volume
 recordings show diminished amplitude below the knees on both sides.

 IMPRESSION:  Findings do suggest mild tibial disease on both sides despite the
 minimally affected ABIs.  This is slightly worse on the left.  Please consider
 if clinically appropriate, perhaps an exercise exam may help to reveal a
 subtle underlying significant or moderate stenosis.

84094,84686,35,166707.0,2122-02-10,,,Echo,Report,,,"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: Intraoperative TEE for CABG, AVR, MVR, Seotal myomectomy
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2122-2-10**] at 11:37
Test: TEE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: Elongated LA. No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the
body of the [**Name Prefix (Prefixes) 4**] [**Last Name (Prefixes) 5**] LAA. Mild spontaneous echo contrast in the LAA. All four
pulmonary veins identified and enter the left atrium.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: A catheter or pacing wire is seen in the RA
and extending into the RV. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Wall thickness and cavity dimensions were obtained from 2D
images. Moderate symmetric LVH. Small LV cavity. Normal regional LV systolic
function. Overall normal LVEF (>55%).

LV WALL MOTION: basal anterior - normal; mid anterior - normal; basal
anteroseptal - normal; mid anteroseptal - normal; basal inferoseptal - normal;
mid inferoseptal - normal; basal inferior - normal; mid inferior - normal;
basal inferolateral - normal; mid inferolateral - normal; basal anterolateral
- normal; mid anterolateral - normal; anterior apex - normal; septal apex -
normal; inferior apex - normal; lateral apex - normal; apex - normal;

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV chamber size and free wall motion.

AORTA: Normal aortic diameter at the sinus level. Focal calcifications in
aortic root. Normal ascending aorta diameter. Focal calcifications in
ascending aorta. Simple atheroma in aortic arch. Focal calcifications in
aortic arch. Mildly dilated descending aorta. Simple atheroma in descending
aorta. Focal calcifications in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Three aortic valve leaflets. Moderately thickened aortic valve
leaflets. Severe AS (AoVA <0.8cm2). Mild (1+) AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Moderately thickened mitral valve leaflets. Moderate mitral
annular calcification. Moderate MS (MVA 1.0-1.5cm2) Due to co-existing AR, the
pressure half-time estimate of mitral valve area may be an OVERestimation of
true area. Mild to moderate ([**11-25**]+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild [1+] TR.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Pulmonic valve not well seen.

PERICARDIUM: Trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. No TEE related
complications. The patient was under general anesthesia throughout the
procedure. The patient appears to be in sinus rhythm. Results were personally
reviewed with the MD caring for the patient.

Conclusions:
This patient's intraoperative study is stored on two separate examinations.
The first study, of which there are 72 clips represents pre-CPB images. The
medical record number corresponding to this study is missing the last digit.
The second set of images represents both pre and post CPB clips.

PRE-CPB The left atrium is elongated. Mild spontaneous echo contrast is seen
in the left atrial appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color
Doppler. There is moderate symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular septum encroaches on the left ventricular outflow tract. The left
ventricular cavity is small. Regional left ventricular wall motion is normal.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is normal (LVEF>55%). Right
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There are simple
atheroma in the aortic arch. There are focal calcifications in the aortic
arch. The descending thoracic aorta is mildly dilated. There are simple
atheroma in the descending thoracic aorta. There are three aortic valve
leaflets. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is severe
aortic valve stenosis (area <0.8cm2) by continuity but by planimetry the
aortic valve area is about 1 cm2. This may be due to a subvalvular gradient.
Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are
moderately thickened. There is moderate mitral stenosis (area 1.0-1.5cm2). Due
to co-existing aortic regurgitation, the pressure half-time estimate of mitral
valve area may be an OVERestimation of true mitral valve area. Mild to
moderate ([**11-25**]+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is a trivial/physiologic
pericardial effusion.

POST CPB There is normal right ventricular systolic function. There is normal
LV systolic function. The patient is status post septal myomectomy. No
interventricular flow is seen in this area but because of acoustic shadowing
but a small VSD cannot be completely ruled out. A bioprosthesis is located in
the mitral position. It appears well seated and displays normal leaflet
motion. There is evidence of prosthetic mitral valve leaflet [**Male First Name (un) 8**] without LVOT
obstruction. There is trace valvular and perivalvular mitral regurgitation. A
maximum gradient of 13 mm Hg and a mean gradient of 5 mm Hg is measured across
this valve. A bioprosthesis is also noted in the aortic position. It also
appears well seated with normal leaflet function. There is trace valvular AI.
Trace perivalvular AI is also likely present but acoustic shadowing prevents
complete evaluation. There is a significant pressure gradient (between 40-60
mm Hg) noted upon Doppler interrogation of the LVOT and aortic valve. Based on
color and pulse wave Doppler readings, it appears that this gradient is due to
the proximity of the mitral valve prosthesis strut and the ventricular septum.

These findings were discussed in detail with Drs. [**Last Name (STitle) 137**] and [**Name5 (PTitle) 304**]
in the operating room.

 INDICATION:  Status post recent CABG, and aortic and mitral valve
 replacements.

 COMPARISON:  The last available chest radiograph from [**2122-2-3**] was
 obtained preoperatively.

 TECHNIQUE AND FINDINGS:  A portable frontal chest radiograph was obtained in
 supine position at 1415.

 Heart size remains normal.  Lungs are clear except for few linear opacities
 consistent with early postoperative atelectasis, mild.  Transparence of both
 lungs is otherwise symmetric.  An endotracheal tube is present, with its tip
 at the level of the medial ends of the clavicles, approximately 4 cm above the
 carina.  A Swan-Ganz catheter, introduced through a right internal jugular
 venous approach, is in place as well, with its tip at the level of the right
 pulmonary artery. Three chest/mediastinal tubes are visualized, two in the
 midline and one at the left lung base.  A nasogastric tube is seen with its
 tip at the level of the greater tuberosity and its side hole not visualized.
 Prosthetic heart valve, metallic clips and sternotomy wires are noted.
 Calcified polygonal formations in the right upper quadrant are suggestive of
 gallstones.

 CONCLUSION:  Unremarkable early postoperative appearance.  Lines and tubes as
 described above.  No pneumothorax.

 HISTORY:  CABG and aortic valve replacement, status post chest tube removal.

 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated [**2122-2-13**].

 FINDINGS:  Despite the given history, no chest tube has been removed since the
 intervening radiograph.  The endotracheal tube and right internal jugular
 vascular sheath remains stable in position.  A nasogastric tube has been
 placed.  However, it extends off the inferior margin of the radiograph and the
 tip is not seen.  There is a relatively moderately sized posteriorly layering
 pleural effusion.  The pulmonary vasculature is mildly indistinct possibly
 secondary to mild underlying volume overload.  No definite focal consolidation
 is seen.  There is a tortuous aorta.  The cardiac silhouette remains enlarged
 but stable.  There is stable course and position of the dual chamber
 pacemaker.

 IMPRESSION:  Interval placement of nasogastric tube as above.  There is a
 relatively large posteriorly layering left pleural effusion.

 HISTORY:  Atrial flutter and extensive cardiac history.  Assess for interval
 change.

 FINDINGS:

 COMPARISON:  Multiple priors, the most recent dated [**2122-2-14**].

 FINDINGS:  The patient has been extubated and the nasogastric tube removed.
 The right internal jugular approach vascular sheath remains in place.  There
 is stable course and position of a dual-chamber pacemaker as well.  Despite
 the upright position of the now acquired radiograph, the hazy veiling opacity
 in the left lower hemithorax is again evident with no significant layering of
 the pleural effusion.  This suggests possible loculation.  The opacity is
 atypical for a true parenchymal consolidation.  The right lung is largely
 clear.  There is no pneumothorax.

 IMPRESSION:  Persistent hazy opacity in the left mid lung and base.  Given the
 upright radiograph, the suspected posteriorly layering pleural effusion may
 have loculated components.  The opacity is atypical for a true parenchymal
 consolidation although this cannot be entirely excluded.  If clinically
 feasible, consider bilateral decubitus views or CT scanning for further
 evaluation.

 ______________________________________________________________________________
                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Status post CABG with sternal debridement, unstable sternotomy.
 Evaluate sternum.

 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray, [**2131-5-12**].

 TECHNIQUE:  Multidetector helical scanning of the chest was performed without
 IV contrast.  Images were displayed using 5-mm slice thickness, in both soft
 tissue and lung algorithm windows.  Additional 2.5-mm images were obtained and
 sagittal images were obtained of both the chest and the sternum.

 NON-CONTRAST CHEST CT:  The patient is status post CABG, with median
 sternotomy wires and numerous CABG clips.  There has been a dehiscence of the
 sternum, with separation of the two sternum measuring up to 1.7 cm near the
 xiphoid process.  The most inferior sternal wires do not include the right
 side of the sternum.  There is also an extensive fluid collection posterior to
 the sternum measuring 10 x 4 cm in the coronal plane.  In the axial plane, the
 fluid collection measures 2.2 x 3.4 cm for the majority of its length, however
 expands to 8 x 1.5 cm at the xiphoid process.  There is also a small amount of
 fluid and stranding in the soft tissues anterior to the sternum.

 Heart size is normal.  There are scattered atherosclerotic calcifications
 within the native coronary vessels.  On this non-contrast scan, the great
 vessels appear unremarkable.  Small mediastinal lymph nodes measuring up to 5
 mm in short axis are noted.  No pathologically enlarged mediastinal, hilar or
 axillary lymph nodes.

 The bronchi are patent to the subsegmental level.  There are small bilateral
 pleural effusions layering posteriorly with adjacent atelectasis at the lung
 bases.  Additionally throughout the lung parenchyma are peripheral scattered
 ground-glass glass opacities with an upper lobe predominance.  This pattern
 suggests a chronic restrictive or inhalational process, rather than infection.

 Limited views of the upper abdomen demonstrate numerous hypodense lesions
 within the liver, which cannot be fully characterized on this non-contrast
 scan, however likely represent cysts.  Partial view of the right kidney
 demonstrates caliceal fullness, which may represent hydronephrosis (though
 there is no perinephric stranding) or a parapelvic cyst.

 BONE WINDOWS:  See description of sternal dehiscence above.  The vertebral

 column demonstrates degenerative changes of the lower thoracic spine with
 early DISH developing at T9-10 and T10-11.  No suspicious lytic or sclerotic
 lesions.

 Multiplanar reformats confirm the above findings.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Sternal dehiscence with an extensive fluid collection extending along the
 entire length of the sternum.  While this measures simple fluid density,
 infection cannot be excluded.
 2.  Bilateral pleural effusions measuring simple fluid density.
 3.  Scattered peripheral ground-glass opacities with upper lobe predominance
 and scattered foci of peripheral fibrotic changes are more suggestive of
 chronic restrictive or inhalational process, rather than infection.
 4.  Hypodense lesions within the liver are likely cysts, thought cannot be
 fully characterized on this non-contrast scan.
 5.  Right renal pelvic fullness, not completely imaged on this chest CT, may
 reflect mild hydronephrosis or a parapelvic cyst.  Recommend correlation with
 the clinical picture.  If indicated, a right renal ultrasound could further
 evaluate this finding.

 INDICATION:  69-year-old male with open chest, status post washout and
 closure.  Evaluate line placement.

 COMPARISON:  [**2131-5-18**], 3:30 p.m.

 SINGLE SUPINE PORTABLE CHEST RADIOGRAPH:  Compared to three hours prior, there
 has been little interval change with the exception of the placement of a right
 internal jugular catheter which terminates in the distal SVC.  The vascular
 sheath has been removed.  Again demonstrated is an endotracheal tube which
 terminates in the mid thoracic trachea, unchanged in position.  Multiple chest
 tubes are again identified.  There are multiple fixation plates overlying the
 mediastinum along with vertically oriented staples and wires consistent with
 provided history.  The hila are prominent bilaterally with diffuse
 interstitial opacities consistent with mild pulmonary edema which appears to
 have improved slightly compared to prior study. There is a large area of
 subtle lucency along the medial left lower lung, raising the possibilty of an
 anterior pneumothorax.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Interval placement of right internal jugular catheter with tip in the
 distal SVC.
 2.  Mild improvement in pulmonary edema.
 3.  Possible left anterior pneumothorax.

 HISTORY:  69-year-old man with CABG, new pulmonary embolism.

 TECHNIQUE:  Multiple images of bilateral upper extremities were obtained at
 the bedside.

 FINDINGS:

 RIGHT UPPER EXTREMITY:  The right subclavian vein, internal jugular vein,
 axillary, brachial veins are widely patent.  There is normal respiratory
 phasicity and compression.  The right basilic vein is also widely patent
 without grayscale evidence for clot and with normal compression.  The right
 cephalic vein is thrombosed without evidence for flow and with grayscale
 evidence for clot.

 LEFT UPPER EXTREMITY:  There is a large amount of clot distending the internal
 jugular vein that is fairly occlusive.  The left subclavian vein does not
 demonstrate clot with evidence for persistent flow and appropriate
 compressibility in its visualized portion.  The axillary and brachial veins
 are widely patent.  The left cephalic vein demonstrates grayscale evidence for
 clot without evidence for compression.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Large amount of clot distending the left internal jugular vein that is
 fairly occlusive.  The visualized aspect of the left subclavian vein does not
 demonstrate internal clot.
 2.  Superficial thrombosis of the right and left cephalic veins.  Findings
 communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 2437**] at the time of dictation.

 FINDINGS:

 RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY:  The right common femoral vein is widely patent and
 demonstrates normal compressibility without grayscale evidence for clot.
 Evaluation of the femoral vein (SFV) demonstrates no compression with
 grayscale bulk clot extending along its length.  This clot demonstrates
 moderate occlusion.  The popliteal vein is patent.  The deep femoral vein is
 patent.

 LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY:  The left common femoral vein is widely patent with
 normal compressibility and respiratory augmentation.  The left femoral vein
 (SFV) demonstrates widely patent flow with appropriate compression and
 respiratory augmentation.  The popliteal vein is unremarkable.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY: Extensive thrombosis of the right femoral vein
 along its entire length and no significant internal flow.
 2.  LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY: No evidence for DVT.

68075,67801,36,122659.0,2131-05-19,,,Echo,Report,,,"PATIENT/TEST INFORMATION:
Indication: history of PE, assess PA pressure and RV function
Height: (in) 70
Weight (lb): 240
BSA (m2): 2.26 m2
BP (mm Hg): 122/74
HR (bpm): 92
Status: Inpatient
Date/Time: [**2131-5-19**] at 11:09
Test: Portable TEE (Complete)
Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Adequate


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus in the LA/LAA or the
RA/RAA.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Dynamic interatrial septum. No ASD by 2D or
color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH. Hyperdynamic LVEF >75%.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Moderately dilated RV cavity. Moderate global RV free wall
hypokinesis. Abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with RV
pressure overload.

AORTA: Simple atheroma in descending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Normal aortic valve leaflets (3). Trace AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Normal mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Normal tricuspid valve leaflets. Mild to moderate [[**1-9**]+] TR.
Severe PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: Thickened pulmonic valve leaflets.

PERICARDIUM: Small pericardial effusion. No echocardiographic signs of
tamponade.

GENERAL COMMENTS: A TEE was performed in the location listed above. I certify
I was present in compliance with HCFA regulations. The patient was monitored
by a nurse [**First Name (Titles) 1**] [**Last Name (Titles) 2**] throughout the procedure. The patient was sedated for
the TEE. Medications and dosages are listed above (see Test Information
section). No TEE related complications.

Conclusions:
No spontaneous echo contrast or thrombus is seen in the body of the left
atrium/left atrial appendage or the body of the right atrium/right atrial
appendage. No atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is
mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. Left ventricular systolic
function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). The right ventricular cavity is moderately
dilated. There is moderate global right ventricular free wall hypokinesis.
There is abnormal systolic septal motion/position consistent with right
ventricular pressure overload. There are simple atheroma in the descending
thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with
good leaflet excursion. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are structurally normal. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen.
There is severe pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. The pulmonic valve
leaflets are thickened. There is a small pericardial effusion. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade, however, in the setting of RV pressure
overload, tamponde cannot be entirely ruled out.

Impression: Hyperdynamic mildly hypertrophied LV. Moderately depressed RV with
severe pulmonary hypertension on NO.

Post discontinuation of NO: There is no significant change of RV function or
estimated PA pressure. Tricuspid regurgitation has increased to moderate.

 COMPARISON:  Study from [**2131-5-12**].

 BILATERAL UPPER EXTREMITY VENOUS ULTRASOUND:  There is limited evaluation of
 the right internal jugular vein.  Grayscale and color Doppler son[**Name (NI) 864**] was
 performed of the right and left cephalic, basilic, brachial, axillary and
 subclavian veins, and of the left IJ vein.  The right IJ was not visualized
 secondary to overlying bandages.

 Again seen is distention of the left IJ, left cephalic, and right cephalic
 with clot, without intraluminal flow.  There is also new occlusion of the left
 superficial basilic vein.  The remainder of the venous structures demonstrates
 normal flow, compressibility, and augmentation with normal waveforms.

 IMPRESSION:  Persistent areas of intraluminal thrombus in the left IJ, and
 within the superficial veins of the left and right cephalic veins, and new
 thrombus in the superficial left basilic vein.

 TYPE OF EXAMINATION:  Chest PA and lateral.

 INDICATION:  Status post bypass surgery one week ago, now with chest pain at
 incision site and drainage.  No fevers.  Also has gradual onset of shortness
 of breath and fatigue.  Evaluate for effusions.

 FINDINGS:  Frontal view demonstrates status post anterior chest wall
 reconstruction with four bars of hardware in horizontal position.  Position of
 previously described chest tubes is unchanged including right jugular approach
 central venous line.  No pneumothorax is identified in the apical regions.
 Since the last preceding study of [**5-22**], apparently a right-sided PICC line
 has been added, seen to terminate overlying the SVC some 3 cm above the level
 of the carina.  The mild blunting of the left lateral pleural sinus persists
 and the lateral view discloses also some blunting of the posterior pleural
 sinuses representing postoperative findings.

 Position of longitudinally directed multiple wire loops in the sternal area
 appears unchanged and the row of subcutaneous clips is identified in the
 anterior chest wall suture line, but no significant soft tissue changes can be
 identified.

 IMPRESSION:  Stable postoperative chest findings since [**2131-5-22**].

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  69-year-old status post sternal rewiring requiring IV
 antibiotics.

 RADIOLOGISTS:  The procedure was performed by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 5344**], with Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 169**],
 the attending physician [**Name Initial (PRE) **].

 PROCEDURE AND FINDINGS:  Patient was placed supine on the angiographic table.
 Due to prior ultrasounds demonstrating extensive thrombus within the left
 upper extremity, the right upper extremity was chosen for the PICC line.
 Ultrasound demonstrated an appropriate right basilic vein which was punctured
 with a 21-gauge micropuncture needle, through which a 0.018 guide wire was
 advanced into the SVC.  A single lumen PICC trimmed to 35 cm and was advanced
 under fluoroscopic guidance with its tip placed in the distal SVC.  Final
 fluoroscopic image was taken to confirm tip placement.  Hard copy ultrasound
 images were printed before and after venous puncture to confirm patency. There
 are no immediate post-procedure complications.

 IMPRESSION:  Successful placement of 35 cm single lumen PICC via the right
 basilic vein with its tip in the distal SVC; line ready for use.

Pertinent Results:
[**2131-5-13**] Chest CT Scan: Sternal dehiscence with an extensive
fluid collection extending along the entire length of the
sternum. While this measures simple fluid density, infection
cannot be excluded. Bilateral pleural effusions measuring simple
fluid density.
[**2131-5-17**] Echo: There is a moderate sized pericardial effusion.
The effusion appears circumferential. There are no
echocardiographic signs of tamponade.
[**2131-5-18**] LE U/S: 1. RIGHT LOWER EXTREMITY: Extensive thrombosis
of the right femoral vein along its entire length and no
significant internal flow. 2. LEFT LOWER EXTREMITY: No evidence
for DVT.
[**2131-5-18**] Echo: The right atrium is moderately dilated. A
mass/thrombus associated with a catheter/pacing wire is seen in
the right atrium and/or right ventricle. This mass disappeared
later in the exam. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen
ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with
maneuvers. The left ventricular cavity is unusually small and
hyperdynamic. There is mild LVH. Regional left ventricular wall
motion is normal. Overall left ventricular systolic function is
normal (LVEF>55%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall
motion are normal. Right ventricular systolic function is
borderline normal. There are simple atheroma in the aortic arch
and the descending thoracic aorta. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no
aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve appears structurally
normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate to severe
[3+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. All findings discussed
with surgeons at the time of the exam.
[**2131-5-24**] UE U/S: Persistent areas of intraluminal thrombus in the
left IJ, and within the superficial veins of the left and right
cephalic veins, and new thrombus in the superficial left basilic
vein.

Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [**Known lastname 27218**] was admitted [**5-12**] with sternal instability and
[**Month/Day (1) 1834**] chest CT scan which confirmed sternal dehiscence. It
was also notable for an extensive fluid collection extending
along the entire length of the sternum. He was empirically
started on antibiotics and taken to the operating room on [**5-15**]
for sternal re-wiring. There was no evidence of sternal wound
infection. Postoperatively, he was maintained on antibiotics and
wound irrigation. On [**5-17**] in the early AM, he became acutely
hypotensive and increased his chest tube drainage. Transferred
to the CSRU, Swan placed, and transfused one unit. Emergent Echo
revealed a moderate sized pericardial effusion that appeared
circumferential. His chest was ultimately opened emergently in
the unit for washout, and returned to the OR for complete
washout and a hole in the vein graft was sutured closed. Please
see op reports for surgical details. Following surgery he was
transferred to the with open chest and plastic surgery was
consulted regarding sternal plating. The following day he was
brought back to the operating room for chest closure. Echo done
at that time revealed an acute Pulmonary Embolism/Thrombus in
the RA/RV. This mass/thrombus disappeared later on exam. He then
[**Month/Year (2) 1834**] sternal plating closure/bil. pectoralis flaps done by
plastic surgery. Following surgery he was again transferred back
to the CSRU for invasive monitoring. Argatroban started for
presumed HIT (eventually came back negative) and Hematology
consulted. On [**5-21**] he was weaned from sedation, awoke
neurologically intact and extubated. Following extubation a
bedside swallow study was done, which he initially failed, but
repeated [**5-23**] with improvement. Also on [**5-23**] he was transferred
to the SDU for further care. Extremity U/S revealed thrombus in
his right femoral vein, left IJ, superficial veins of the left
and right cephalic veins, and in the superficial left basilic
vein. On [**5-24**] a PICC line was placed. Although operative wound
cultures were eventually negative, per ID, he will receive 4
weeks of vancomycin for high risk of sternal contamination. He
continued to improve and worked with physical therapy during his
post-op course for strength and mobility. On [**5-25**] he was
discharged to rehab facility with the appropriate follow-up
appointments. Of note, he will remain on Coumadin for DVT/PE for
minimum of 6 months.

Doppler: Full Doppler and color Doppler
Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Suboptimal


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

This study was compared to the prior study of [**2131-5-19**].


LEFT ATRIUM: Mild LA enlargement.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: Moderately dilated RA. Normal interatrial
septum. No ASD by 2D or color Doppler.

LEFT VENTRICLE: Mild symmetric LVH with normal cavity size and global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Suboptimal technical quality, a focal LV wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. No resting LVOT gradient. No VSD.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: Normal RV systolic function. Abnormal septal motion/position.

AORTA: Mildly dilated aortic sinus. Mildly dilated ascending aorta.

AORTIC VALVE: Mildly thickened aortic valve leaflets (3). No AS. No AR.

MITRAL VALVE: Mildly thickened mitral valve leaflets. No MVP. No MS. Mild (1+)
MR.

TRICUSPID VALVE: Tricuspid valve not well visualized. TR present - cannot be
quantified. Moderate PA systolic hypertension.

PULMONIC VALVE/PULMONARY ARTERY: No PS.

PERICARDIUM: No pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality - poor echo windows.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right atrium is moderately dilated. No
atrial septal defect is seen by 2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric
left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic
function (LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion
abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no ventricular septal defect.
RV appears to have normal free wall contractility (poor image quality). There
is abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the
sinus level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets
(3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic
regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There
is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid
regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. There is moderate pulmonary
artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-5-19**], the RV funciton
has probably improved. If indicated, a cardiac MRI may better assess RV size
and systolic function.

 CHEST X-RAY

 INDICATION:  Endotracheal tube and orogastric tube placement.

 FINDINGS:  As compared to the previous radiograph, a new endotracheal tube has
 been placed.  The tip of the tube projects 3 cm above the carina.  The course
 of the nasogastric tube is unremarkable, but its tip is difficult to identify.

 There is no evidence of complication, notably no pneumothorax.

 Bilateral chest tubes are in place.  Also unchanged are the sternal fixations.
 In slightly different patient position, the bilateral parenchymal opacities
 that preexisted appears unchanged in extent, with a potential minimal increase
 on the right.

 The size of the cardiac silhouette is unchanged.  Also unchanged are the
 retrocardiac areas of atelectasis.

 No other changes.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Normal position of endotracheal tube.  Normal course of nasogastric tube
 with likely normal position in the central parts of the stomach.
 2.  Unchanged course and position of the bilateral chest tubes.  Overall
 unchanged extent of the pre-existing bilateral parenchymal opacities.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 PROCEDURE:  CTA chest.

 REASON FOR EXAM:  Assess for PE.  Acute hypoxia.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCTA chest was performed initially as a low-dose non-contrast
 protocol followed by administration of IV contrast with transaxial images from
 the apices to the lower lungs with multiplanar reformats.

 The CT was reported in conjunction with the previous CT, [**2131-6-22**].

 FINDINGS:

 There is satisfactory contrast opacification of the pulmonary arteries with a
 filling defect in the lobar left upper lobe pulmonary artery consistent with a
 pulmonary embolus and better seen on the left oblique reformats (402b.71). The
 caliber of the pulmonary artery is normal.  No acute aortic pathology is noted
 on the pre or post-contrast images.
 Centrilobular emphysema is upper lobe predominant and severe.  Diffuse
 geographically distributed ground-glass opacities are throughout the upper
 lobes and in the superior segment of the right lower lobe which have a
 reticular-type appearance due to coexisting centrilobular emphysema.

 The right-sided airways from the bronchus intermedius distally are
 circumferentially narrowed mainly due to retained secretions which are causing
 partial collapse of the right lower lobe; however there may be additional
 thickening of the airways which are difficult to accurately assess due to the
 secretions and surrounding enlarged lymph nodes.
 Bilateral pleural effusions are small and atelectasis in the left lower lobe
 is mild.

 The heart size is normal with a small pericardial effusion which is most
 likely physiological.  Calcification is diffuse throughout the coronary
 arteries with a previous CABG.

 This study was not designed for subdiaphragmatic evaluation except to note a
 mesh in the anterior upper abdominal soft tissues, consistent with the recent
 ventral hernia repair.Sternal wires and external fixation devices are
 throughout the sternum and sternal drains pass along the anterior chest wall.

 (Cont)
 posterior to the left scapula (2.8) contains tiny septations.
 No destructive or sclerotic bone lesions worrisome for malignancy.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Left upper lobe lobar pulmonary embolism.
 2.  Partial right lower lobe collapse due to a combination of dependent
 secretions and bronchial wall thickening, with associated surrounding
 peribronchial lymph nodes which are probably reactive; however, a followup CT
 is recommended in four to six weeks to ensure resolution.
 3.  Diffuse ground-glass opacities superimposed on centrilobular emphysema are
 most likely infectious (such as viral in origin); aspiration and asymetrical
 edema are less likely.
 4.  Large fatty lesion posterior to the left scapula contains internal
 septations; considering large size and septations, a dedicated MRI with
 contrast is recommended for further evaluation to help distinguish a lipoma
 from a low grade liposarcoma.
 5.  New ventral hernia mesh with postoperative changes in the soft tissues of
 the anterior chest and upper abdomen.
 6.  Diffuse coronary artery calcification with CABG.
 The findings of the pulmonary embolism were conveyed to the referring team at
 the time of reporting.

 HISTORY:  Prior surgery with shortness of breath.

 FINDINGS:  In comparison with the study of [**5-16**], there are again diffuse
 bilateral pulmonary opacifications consistent with the patient's known chronic
 pulmonary disease.  It would be impossible to exclude some supervening
 pulmonary vascular congestion.  The cardiomediastinal silhouette is unchanged.

Chief Complaint:
Recurrent ventral herniation with omentum up in the anterior
chest

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
Ventral hernia repair, placement of SurgiMend and omentectomy.
Sternal plate removal.


History of Present Illness:
Mr. [**Known lastname 27218**] is a 72 y.o. male with PMH significant for CAD s/p
CABG ([**2131-5-4**]), COPD, HTN who presents with recurrent ventral
hernia.

Approximately three years ago ([**2131-5-18**]), the patient had a
sternal repair done with plates. He had an omental transfer and
at that time a ventral hernia repair to the anterior fascia at
the bottom of sternotomy lead to a hernia. This was actually
repaired primarily and reinforced with mesh. A separate new hole
was made through the diaphragm for the omental transfer. Over
time omentum and bowel has protruded up through this hole in the
diaphragm, as evidenced on a recent CT. He now comes in for
repair of this defect. In addition was planning on removal of
his plates as he was having some discomfort. He understood we
could not guarantee success and further intervention may be
required.

Blood and sputum cx - No Growth to date.

ECG ([**2134-5-11**]) - Sinus rhythm. Normal tracing. Since the previous
tracing of [**2134-5-4**] sinus bradycardia is absent.

CXR ([**2134-5-11**]) - Mild bibasilar atelectasis documented on the CTA
performed subsequently, 8:00 a.m. on [**5-12**] and available at the
time of this dictation, in combination with pulmonary embolism
demonstrated on that study is sufficient to explain hypoxia.
There is no pulmonary edema. Heart size is probably normal and
unchanged. There is no pulmonary edema. Left pleural thickening
is chronic.

Echo ([**2134-5-12**]) - The left atrium is mildly dilated. The right
atrium is moderately dilated. No atrial septal defect is seen by
2D or color Doppler. There is mild symmetric left ventricular
hypertrophy with normal cavity size and global systolic function
(LVEF>55%). Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall
motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. There is no
ventricular septal defect. RV appears to have normal free wall
contractility (poor image quality). There is abnormal septal
motion/position. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus
level. The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve
leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not
present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve
leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve
prolapse. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Tricuspid
regurgitation is present but cannot be quantified. There is
moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no
pericardial effusion.
Compared with the prior study (images reviewed) of [**2131-5-19**],
the RV funciton has probably improved. If indicated, a cardiac
MRI may better assess RV size and systolic function.

CXR ([**2134-5-12**]) - IMPRESSION: Asymmetric pulmonary edema, new since
one day prior.

CTA Chest ([**2134-5-12**]) - IMPRESSION:
1. Left upper lobe lobar pulmonary embolism.
2. Partial right lower lobe collapse due to a combination of
dependent secretions and bronchial wall thickening, with
associated surrounding peribronchial lymph nodes which are
probably reactive; however, a followup CT is recommended in four
to six weeks to ensure resolution.
3. Diffuse ground-glass opacities superimposed on centrilobular
emphysema are most likely infectious (such as viral in origin);
aspiration and asymetrical edema are less likely.
4. Large fatty lesion posterior to the left scapula contains
internal septations; considering large size and septations, a
dedicated MRI with contrast is recommended for further
evaluation to help distinguish a lipoma from a low grade
liposarcoma.
5. New ventral hernia mesh with postoperative changes in the
soft tissues of the anterior chest and upper abdomen.
6. Diffuse coronary artery calcification with CABG.

Bilateral LENIs ([**2134-5-13**]) - IMPRESSION: No evidence of DVT of
bilateral lower extremities.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was taken to the operating room for a joint
procedure between Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] of plastic surgery and Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
of general surgery.  He [**Last Name (STitle) 1834**] the following procedures:
(1) Repair of chest wall hernia (Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) **]
(2) Ventral hernia repair, placement of SurgiMend and
omentectomy. Sternal plate removal (Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **]
.
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was transferred to
the floor for routine post operate care.  He initially had poor
pain control and his PCA was titrated up.  He was kept strictly
NPO until return of bowel function.  Unfortunately, he developed
acute respiratory distress during the early morning hours of
[**2134-5-12**] that necessitated transfer to the medical intensive care
unit.
.
# Pulmonary: On POD 2, the patient was transferred to the ICU
for ongoing respiratory distress and hypoxia. He had been on 4L
NC since he was in the OR; however, he desaturated to the high
80's. Also, he had had ongoing difficulty with deep breaths
secondary to abdominal pain. CTA during this decompensation
showed pulmonary embolism. Imaging was also concerning for
underlying pneumonia as well as fluid overload. Shortly after
transfer to the ICU, the patient was noted to have worsening
hypercarbic respiratory failure and depressed mental status.
Ultimately, he was intubated on [**2134-5-12**]. The patient was started
on antibiotics to cover for his pneumonia (see below). Diuresis
was intially limited [**2-9**] hypotension; however, his blood
pressures improved and he was ultimately diuresed. After a few
days of antibiotics and diuresis, the patient's respiratory
status improved. His sedating medications were weaned and he was
ultimately extubated on [**2134-5-15**]. He was called out to the floor
on the day following his extubation and remained stable from a
pulmonary standpoint.
.
During the initial workup of his respiratory distress, a left
upper lobe lobar pulmonary embolism was noted on CTA. Of note,
patient does have a history of clots right femoral vein, left
IJ, superficial veins of the left and right cephalic veins,
superficial left basilic vein, and pulmonary embolism in setting
of surgery for cardiac tamponade s/p CABG [**5-14**]. Per Hematology
patient should have a minimum of 6 months of anticoagulation. In
2 months the patient will follow-up with hematology for
additional work-up and determination of total length of
anticoagulation. Mr. [**Known lastname 27218**] was initially on a conservative
heparin drip given he is recently post-operative. He was
continued on heparin until his INR was therapeutic.
.
He continued on oxygen via nasal cannula at a rate of 4 LPM for
the remainder of his admission and was maintaining an oxygen
saturation > 94%.  He continued pulmonary toilet with incentive
spirometry.  He responded well to intermittent doses of lasix
and was started on standing lasix 20mg by mouth daily.
.
Pneumonia - Patient with likely pneumonia based on imaging and
clinical history (reported approximately 1 week of cough during
the week prior to surgery). Large amount of secretions noted
during intubation. Pt started on levofloxacin on admission to
ICU. After intubation, ceftriaxone was added as double-coverage
to treat for severe CAP. Sputum and blood cx were sent but had
no growth to date at the time of transfer out of the ICU. On
transfer out of the ICU, the patient was continued on
levofloxacin / ceftriaxone with an end date of [**2134-5-21**].
.
# Neuro: Post-operatively, the patient received Dilaudid via PCA
initially with poor pain control that was then transitioned to
PO dilaudid with good effect and adequate pain control.
.
# CV: Patient had troponin leak in setting pneumonia and
pulmonary embolism felt to be demand. The patient was evaluated
by the cardiology service during this admission.  They
recommended that the patient should discuss with his outpatient
cardiologist the utility of continuing plavix, given the
anticoagulation that will be started for his PE. Plavix was
restarted towards the end of the [**Hospital 228**] hospital admission.
.
Multiple EKGs were performed throughout this hospitalization
that did not detect any new ST or T wave abnormalities or any
other findings concerning for ischemia.
.
# GI/GU: Post-operatively, the patient was given IV fluids until
tolerating oral intake. His diet was advanced when appropriate,
which was tolerated well. He was also started on a bowel regimen
to encourage bowel movement. Intake and output were
closely monitored, and urine output was noted to be marginal on
several occasions.  The patient initially received boluses of
IVF with improvement in his urine output.  After these boluses,
however, the patient was thought to be in fluid overload and
received lasix.  His urine output increased with lasix, as well.
.
The patient was continued on his home dose of finasteride for
his BPH.
.
ID: The patient was started on antibiotics for hospital acquired
pneumonia as above.
The patient's  temperature was closely watched for signs of
infection.
.
# Hematology: The patient's hematocrit did trend downwards
slightly after his transfer to the ICU. Hematocrit was followed
and remained stable thereafter. Of note, when patient was
intubated, OG tube was placed and moderate amount of brown
guaiac positive liquid was aspirated back; patient was kept on
heparin gtt and started on [**Hospital1 **] IV PPI.  When his plavix was
restarted, his PPI was transitioned to an H2 blocker due to the
interaction between these two medications.
.
# Musculoskeletal: The patient had difficulty ambulating and
getting out of bed.  This was thought to be due to
deconditioning.  A PT consult was requested and the patient
[**Hospital1 1834**] vigorous physical therapy.  He will require continued
physical therapy at rehab.
.
# Prophylaxis: The patient was maintained on subcutaneous
heparin after his operation.  He was transitioned to heparin
drip at the time of his pulmonary embolism, and eventually was
started on coumadin.  At the time of his discharge, his INR was
4.1 ([**2134-5-19**]).  His INR from [**2134-5-20**] was still pending.

 PORTABLE CHEST OF [**2131-5-4**]

 COMPARISON:  [**2131-5-1**].

 INDICATION:  Status post coronary artery bypass surgery.

 Endotracheal tube terminates just above the level of the clavicles,
 approximately 6.8 cm above the carina, could be advanced slightly for standard
 positioning.  Swan-Ganz catheter terminates in the distal right pulmonary
 artery, nasogastric tube courses below the diaphragm, and low lying chest tube
 is present on the left as well as midline mediastinal drains.  Cardiac and
 mediastinal contours are slightly widened, likely due to postoperative change.
 Bilateral subtle chronic interstitial lung disease without change allowing for
 technical differences between the exams.  No pleural effusion or pneumothorax
 is identified on this supine projection.

 TWO VIEW CHEST OF [**2131-5-7**].

 COMPARISON:  [**2131-5-4**]

 INDICATION:  Chest tube removal.

 Various lines and tubes have been removed since the prior radiograph, and a
 very small left apical pneumothorax has developed.  Cardiac and mediastinal
 contours are within normal limits for postoperative status of the patient.
 Small pleural effusions and minor bibasilar atelectasis are noted.  These
 findings are superimposed upon subtle likely more chronic peripheral and
 basilar interstitial lung disease.

 On the lateral view, small air-fluid level is present in the retrosternal
 region likely representing an anterior hydropneumothorax, and additional air
 is present in the retrosternal region, an expected postoperative finding given
 the time interval since surgery.

 IMPRESSION:  Small left pneumothorax following tube removal.  Bibasilar
 atelectasis and small pleural effusions.

Recent testing:
[**2131-4-24**]: Echo showed a normal LV size and function.  EF of
60-65%.  The valves were all normal with trace TR.  Pulmonary
systolic pressure was estimated to be 30-35%. [**2131-4-20**]: Nuclear
stress test where the patient exercised for 6 minutes 57 seconds
on [**Initials (NamePattern4) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] protocol stopping due to shortness of breath and leg
pain.  He achieved 68% of his predicted target heart rate.  He
did not develop any arrhythmias or chest pain.  The nuclear
images demonstrated a normal sized left ventricle. There was a
moderate sized reversible perfusion abnormality involving the
anteroapical and septal portion left ventricle. There was also a
question of a small reversible abnormality involving the
inferolateral portion left ventricle.  The left ventricular wall
motion was normal.  The LVEF was 62%.
.
[**2131-4-30**] Cardiac Catheterization
COMMENTS:
1.  Coronary angiography of this right dominant system revealed
severe three vessel coronary artery disease.  The left main
coronary artery had no angiographically apparent flow limiting
stenoses.  The LAD was ectatic proximally and occluded in the
mid segment after a small diagonal.  The LCX had a 90% stenosis
of the OM1 proximally and a 50% followed by a 70% stenosis in
the proximal and mid segment of the OM2. The RCA had a 90%
stenosis in the mid PDA.
2.  Limited resting hemodynamics revealed mildly to moderately
elevated left sided filling pressures (LVEDP was 18 mm Hg).
Systemic arterial pressure was normal (aortic pressure was
121/73 mm Hg).  There was no significant gradient across the
aortic valve upon pullback of the catheter from the left
ventricle to the ascending aorta.
3.  Left ventriculography revealed a contrast calculated
ejection
fraction of 65%.  No mitral regurgitation was noted. 4.
Bilateral selective renal angiography demonstrated widely patent
renal arteries.
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:
1. Three vessel coronary artery disease.
2. Normal left ventricular systolic function.
3. Mildly to moderately elevated left sided filling pressures.
4. No angiographically apparent renal artery stenosis.

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Recent CABG, sternal debridement and repair, now with new fluid
 collection.

 TECHNIQUE:  MDCT was used to obtain contiguous axial images through the chest
 after uneventful administration of 90 mL of Optiray IV contrast.  Standard and
 lung algorithm images as well as coronal reformats were obtained.  This study
 was compared with [**2131-5-13**].

 CHEST CT WITH IV CONTRAST:  Several mediastinal plates are seen; separation of
 the sternal halves is still seen, particularly in the inferior aspect.
 Additionally, a new large presternal fluid collection is present, greatest in
 the space between the topmost and secondmost plates.  In the superior and the
 inferior aspect of the sternotomy, it appears to communicate freely with the
 retrosternal space (series 2, image 40), though the amount of retrosternal
 fluid is markedly diminished since the [**2131-5-13**] study.  There is no
 significant stranding or gas within the fluid collection. The fluid collection
 is somewhat broad- based, measuring approximately 3.0 cm A-P, 13.0 cm
 transverse.

 Small lymph nodes are noted in the mediastinum, the largest measuring 6 mm in
 the precarinal region (2:21).  The pericardium is slightly thickened and
 irregular, which is compatible with history of recent pericardial
 intervention; the focus of pericardial calcification is unchanged.  The heart
 is otherwise normal in size, with extensive coronary vascular calcifications.

 Lungs are notable for mild centrilobular emphysema.  Additionally,
 interstitial reticular opacities, most pronounced in the lung periphery and at
 the bases, are slightly worse than the last examination.  A 4-mm lung nodule
 is seen in the right upper lobe (3:28).  Bilateral pleural effusions are again
 seen; the right is slightly larger than the previous, the left slightly
 smaller; both remains small.  There is associated compressive atelectasis.

 This study is not designed to examine the abdomen, however, multiple low-
 density lesions in the liver are similar to the previous study; several of
 these are too small to fully characterize; the largest is in the left lobe
 measuring 23 mm, with fluid attenuation characteristics.  A left kidney lesion
 measuring 10 mm represents a cyst.  The kidneys are incompletely imaged, but
 fullness of the right collecting system is again seen.  No mass lesions are
 identified in the imaged portion of the spleen or adrenals. There is a small
 layering radiopaque gallstone.

 BONE WINDOWS:  Aside from the sternal anatomy described above, no suspicious
 sclerotic or lytic lesions are identified.  Large lipoma of the left
 infraspinatus muscle is noted.

 IMPRESSION:

 1.  New large presternal fluid collection, with apparent communication with
 the retrosternal space, but amount of retrosternal fluid is small and has
 decreased since prior CT. Findings could represent postoperative seroma, but
 infection should be considered in the appropriate clinical setting. No
 discrete abscess identified.

 2.  Bilateral pleural effusions, small, right greater than left.

 3.  Worsening mild peripheral and basilar reticular and ground glass
 opacities. Given their short interval worsening, a drug reaction should be
 considered. Nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis would be less likely to have
 such a rapid progression.

 4.  Layering radiopaque gallstones.

 5.  A right kidney cyst and liver cyst, unchanged.  Other numerous liver
 lesions are too small to characterize, but similar in appearance to previous
 study.

 6.  Fullness of the right renal collecting system is incompletely imaged;
 clinical correlation and/or imaging correlation recommended.

 7.  4-mm right lung nodule, for which followup is recommended in one year to
 document stability.

 COMPARISON:  Multiple prior chest radiographs with the most recent on [**2131-5-24**].

 CHEST, PA AND LATERAL:  Four metal bars and interlocking screws in the
 anterior chest wall are stable in position and appearance since [**2131-5-24**].
 There has been interval removal of associated cerclage wires with a residual
 strand of wire adjacent to the most inferior metal bar.  An air-filled loop of
 bowel anterior to the hardware is new since [**2131**].

 The cardiac size is normal.  The mediastinal and hilar contours are
 unremarkable.  Slight blunting of the left costophrenic angle may represent
 scarring or tiny effusion.  There is no focal consolidation.  There is no
 pneumothorax or pulmonary vascular congestion.  Moderate spondylosis is
 present in the thoracic spine.

 IMPRESSION:

                                 FINAL REPORT
 INDICATION:  Compared to CTA, [**2134-5-12**].

 TECHNIQUE:  CT imaging of the thorax was performed prior to and following the
 administration of intravenous contrast.  Multiplanar reconstructions were
 generated.

 COMPARISON:  Comparison is made to prior CT performed [**2134-5-12**].

 FINDINGS:

 CT PULMONARY ANGIOGRAM.

 No thrombus is identified within the central or segmental pulmonary arteries.
 Bolus quality is satisfactory.

 CT THORAX:

 Severe centrilobular emphysema is identified in both lungs.  In comparison to
 the prior CT, there has been resolution of bilateral pleural effusions and
 extensive parenchymal ground-glass opacity, most likely representing resolving
 pulmonary edema.  However, there is subpleural interlobular septal thickening
 throughout both lungs, predominantly in a basal distribution.  There are
 subpleural small cystic airspaces, compatible with honeycombing.  These
 changes were not identified on CT performed [**2131-6-22**] and are consistent with
 interstitial lung disease, most likely UIP.  Several small mediastinal lymph
 nodes are identified, which are generally decreased in size in comparison to
 the prior CT.  The largest lymph node in the subcarina measures 1.8 cm x 1.1
 cm in comparison to 1.8 cm x 2.6 cm on the prior scan.  There are extensive
 areas of mural calcification in the coronary arteries in keeping with
 atherosclerosis.  Evidence of prior sternotomy.  Limited views of the liver
 show several small hypoattenuating lesions which are also identified on prior
 CT, [**2131-6-22**] and most likely represent hepatic cysts.  Degenerative changes
 are seen in the thoracic spine.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  No pulmonary embolus is identified.
 2.  Resolution of pulmonary edema seen on previous scan.  Residual areas of
 subpleural interlobular septal thickening and honeycomb formation with basal
 predominance are consistent with interstitial lung disease, most likely UIP.

Contrast: None
Technical Quality: Suboptimal


INTERPRETATION:

Findings:

LEFT ATRIUM: The left atrium is moderately dilated.

RIGHT ATRIUM/INTERATRIAL SEPTUM: The right atrium is mildly dilated.

LEFT VENTRICLE: There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left
ventricular cavity is mildly dilated. Overall left ventricular systolic
function is severely depressed. There is no resting left ventricular outflow
tract obstruction.

RIGHT VENTRICLE: The right ventricular wall thickness is normal. The right
ventricular cavity is dilated. Right ventricular systolic function appears
depressed.

AORTA: The aortic root is normal in diameter. There are focal calcifications
in the aortic root.

AORTIC VALVE: The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but not
stenotic.

MITRAL VALVE: The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no
mitral valve prolapse. There is mild mitral annular calcification. There is
mild thickening of the mitral valve chordae. The tips of the papillary muscles
are calcified. There is no significant mitral stenosis. Mitral regurgitation
is present but cannot be quantified.

TRICUSPID VALVE: The tricuspid valve appears structurally normal with trivial
tricuspid regurgitation.

PERICARDIUM: There is no pericardial effusion.

GENERAL COMMENTS: Suboptimal image quality due to poor echo windows.

Conclusions:
The left atrium is moderately dilated. There is mild symmetric left
ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity is mildly dilated.
Overall left ventricular systolic function is severely depressed, global
(ejection fraction 20 percent). The right ventricular cavity is dilated. Right
ventricular systolic function appears depressed. The aortic valve leaflets (3)
are mildly thickened but not stenotic. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly
thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mitral regurgitation is present
but cannot be quantified. There is no pericardial effusion.

Compared with the findings of the prior study (tape reviewed) of [**2183-1-31**], no major change is evident, but the technically suboptimal nature of
both studies precludes certainty.

 Comparison is made to prior chest radiographs of [**2183-2-4**] and [**8-21**], [**2183**].

 The heart is enlarged but stable in size.  There is persistent upper zone
 vascular redistribution and perihilar haziness.  Additionally, there is an
 area of increased opacity in the lingula which obscures the left heart border.
 Note is made of disruption and malalignment of the sternal wires which is
 unchanged dating back to [**2183-2-1**].

 IMPRESSION:
 1)  Confluent lingular opacity concerning for pneumonia.  When the patient's
 condition permits, more complete evaluation with standard PA and lateral chest
 radiographs is recommended.
 2)  Mild congestive heart failure pattern.
 3)  Malalignment and disruption of multiple sternal wires which appears to be
 chronic.  This may be due to a chronic sternal dehiscence.

Date of Birth:   [**2114-9-17**]     Sex:  M

Service:  C-MED Gold

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 68-year-old
gentleman with a significant cardiac history with coronary
artery disease (status post coronary artery bypass graft),
hypertension, congestive heart failure, hyperlipidemia, and
diabetes mellitus who presented with worsening congestive
heart failure of several months in duration with new onset
chest pressure.

The patient was in his usual state of health until three days
prior to admission when he began to experience increasing
shortness of breath at rest and with exertion. However, the
patient was still able to walk his dog for approximately one
half of a mile per day.  No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  No
orthopnea.  Minimal bilateral lower extremity edema at
baseline.

The patient had one episode of [**5-10**] chest pressure (his
anginal equivalent) with exertion three days prior to
admission which resolved after one hour.

On the day prior to admission, the patient had a second
episode of [**10-10**] chest pressure, substernal, and without
radiation.  No associated nausea, vomiting, or palpitations.
Mild diaphoresis and lightheadedness.  The patient took one
sublingual nitroglycerin, and his pain score went down to
7/10, and he presented to the [**Hospital1 188**] Emergency Department for evaluation.

In the [**Hospital1 **] Emergency Department, the
patient's chest pressure was relieved with aspirin, heparin,
nitroglycerin, and Integrilin.  He also received metoprolol
intravenously.  He did continue to be short of breath despite
receiving 80 mg of Lasix intravenously on arrival.

The initial electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with a
left bundle-branch block and left atrial abnormality, without
any significant changed when compared to the previous tracing
of [**2183-2-22**].  His initial creatine kinase was 326
with a troponin T of 0.31.

Of note, the patient denies fevers or chills.  He has a
slight cough with sputum.  He is not on a low diet.  No
recent dietary indiscretion.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:
1.  Coronary artery disease.

FAMILY HISTORY:   Family history was noncontributory for
coronary artery disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient is a retired painter.  He has
been married times 44 years.  He has a 60-pack-year history
of tobacco; he quit 15 years ago.  Occasional alcohol use.
No intravenous drug use.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  Physical examination
on admission revealed his temperature was 98.4 degrees
Fahrenheit, blood pressure was 133/64, his heart rate was
107, his respiratory rate went from 40 to 24, and his oxygen
saturation was 95% on 2 liters.  In general, an elderly
gentleman in no apparent distress.  Head, eyes, ears, nose,
and throat examination revealed normocephalic and atraumatic.
Pupils were equal, round, and reactive to light and
accommodation.   Extraocular movements were intact.  The neck
was supple.  No lymphadenopathy.  No thyromegaly.
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate.  Normal
first heart sounds and second heart sounds.  No murmurs,
rubs, clicks, or gallops.  Pulmonary examination revealed
decreased breath sounds at the bases bilaterally.  No rales
or wheezes.  The abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, and
nondistended.  Normal active bowel sounds.  No
hepatosplenomegaly or masses.  Extremity examination revealed
2+ pitting edema bilaterally to the knees.  Neurologic
examination revealed alert and oriented times three.  Cranial
nerves II through XII were grossly intact.

PERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Initial
laboratories revealed creatine kinase was 326, CK/MB was 14,
troponin T was 0.25, and MB index was 4.3.  His white blood
cell count was 7.8, his hematocrit was 33, and his platelets
were 281.  Sodium was 135, potassium was 4.2, chloride was
99, bicarbonate was 28, blood urea nitrogen was 24,
creatinine was 1.1, and blood glucose was 303.  Prothrombin
time was 13.8, partial thromboplastin time was 25.2, and his
INR was 1.3.

PERTINENT RADIOLOGY/IMAGING:  A chest x-ray demonstrated
cardiomegaly with pulmonary vasculature redistribution and a
new lingular opacity (pneumonia versus asymmetric pulmonary
edema), and a small calcified granuloma in the right upper
lobe (as previously demonstrated).

BRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:  The
patient was admitted to the C-MED Service, placed on
telemetry, and continued on his outpatient cardiac
medications, as well as a nitroglycerin, heparin, and
Integrilin drips.

1.  CONGESTIVE HEART FAILURE ISSUES:  At baseline, the
patient had been on 2 liters nasal cannula of home oxygen.
His oxygen requirement remained stable while in house on 3
liters nasal cannula.  He was saturating at 97%.

An echocardiogram was performed on [**2183-8-21**] which
demonstrated an ejection fraction of 20% with global
hypokinesis; consistent with prior examination.

The patient was continued on digoxin 0.25 mg by mouth once
per day and Lasix 80 mg intravenously once per day.  Daily
weights and strict ins-and-outs were monitored.  On the day
of discharge, the patient no longer had edema of the lower
extremities.  He was saturating at 100% on 2 liters with his
lungs clear to auscultation bilaterally.

2.  CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient ruled in by
enzyme criteria; however, his electrocardiogram continued to
be unchanged with a left bundle-branch block at baseline.

There was consideration of catheterization during this
inpatient stay; however, given the patient's complications
with gastrointestinal bleeds, as well as his reluctance to
undergo this procedure, this was deferred.

The patient underwent a chemical stress MIBI on [**2183-8-26**]; during which time he had no anginal symptoms or
interpretable electrocardiogram changes.  By verbal report,
the nuclear portion of this study demonstrated fixed defects
in the anterior/inferior walls with an ejection fraction of
20% and left ventricular cavity enlargement.

3.  ANEMIA/GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED ISSUES:  The patient had an
episode of melena on the morning of [**2183-8-22**].  He
denied bright red blood per rectum, hematemesis,
coffee-grounds emesis, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain.
He had never had symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding in the
past.

A nasogastric lavage demonstrated no active upper
gastrointestinal bleed, and his vital signs remained stable
with a stable hematocrit at 29.8.  Two large-bore intravenous
lines were placed, and the patient was transfused a total of
three units of packed red blood cells with 80 mg of
intravenous Lasix prior to this transfusion.  He was also
started on Protonix 40 mg intravenously twice per day.  The
Integrilin, heparin, and aspirin were held.

A Gastroenterology consultation was obtained, and an
esophagogastroduodenoscopy was recommended and performed on
the morning of [**2183-8-23**].  This demonstrated gastritis.
Nevertheless, due to the patient's gastrointestinal bleeding
he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit because
of concern over the initial hematocrit drop from 33 to 26
with a question of potential retroperitoneal bleed.

On [**2183-8-22**], when he was transferred to the Medical
Intensive Care Unit, an abdominal and pelvic computed
tomography without contrast was obtained which demonstrated
some cholelithiasis without evidence for cholecystitis, and
no evidence of retroperitoneal bleed.

An anemia workup was continued, and iron studies demonstrated
an elevated ferritin and decreased total iron-binding
capacity suggesting likely anemia of chronic disease with
acute anemia secondary to gastritis superimposed.

The patient remained stable and was transferred back to the
C-MED Service on the evening of [**2183-8-23**].  For the
duration of his inpatient course, the patient's hematocrit
remained stable at 32.7, and he did not experience subsequent
episodes of melena or hematemesis.

Of note, the aspirin, heparin, and Integrilin continued to be
held (this contributed to the unwillingness to perform
cardiac catheterization during this inpatient stay).

4.  PNEUMONIA ISSUES:  On admission chest x-ray, the patient
was noted to have a lingular infiltrate that was felt to be
new compared to prior studies.  Of note, the patient's white
blood cell count was 7.8, but he did spike to 102.3 degrees
Fahrenheit on [**2183-8-22**].  Thus, it was felt that the
chest x-ray infiltrate was consistent with pneumonia, and he
was started on levofloxacin 500 mg once per day for a 10-day
course.

The patient's chest x-ray gradually improved during his
inpatient stay.  On the day of discharge, his temperature was
99.6 with a white blood cell count of 13.3.  Of note, his
maximum white blood cell count had been 13.9.  The patient
had been afebrile for 48 hours prior to discharge.

5.  DIABETES MELLITUS ISSUES:  The patient was placed on an
insulin sliding-scale with four times per day fingersticks.
His glucose remained within normal limits during this
hospital course.

6.  MENTAL STATUS CHANGE ISSUES:  The patient was minimally
agitated during his Medical Intensive Care Unit stay.  It was
felt that this was likely baseline dementia with superimposed
Intensive Care Unit delirium.  He did have a recent head
computed tomography which showed no acute event.

Of note, his mental status was much improved upon transfer to
the floor.

DISCHARGE DISPOSITION:   The patient was discharged on [**2183-8-26**].  His vital signs were stable.  He was saturating at
100% on 2 liters nasal cannula.  His creatine kinase levels
had been dropping from 187 to 108 with a troponin of 0.31.
He was asymptomatic.

CONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  Condition on discharge was stable.

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES:
1.  Acute non-ST-segment myocardial infarction.
2.  Pneumonia.
3.  Coronary artery disease.
4.  Gastrointestinal bleed.

MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE:
1.  Lipitor 20 mg by mouth once per day.
2.  Celexa 20 mg by mouth by mouth twice per day.
3.  Doxazosin 2-mg tablets one tablet by mouth once per day.
4.  Timolol eyedrops 0.25% one both eyes q.a.m.
5.  Levofloxacin 500-mg tablets one tablet by mouth once per
day (for a 10-day course with day one being on [**2183-8-22**]).
6.  Lisinopril 40 mg by mouth once per day.
7.  Digoxin 250-mg tablets one tablet by mouth once per day.

 HISTORY:  Sixty-eight year old man with NSTE MI, rising Troponin, s/p CABG, low
 EF, hematocrit drop.

 SUMMARY OF EXERCISE DATA FROM THE REPORT OF THE EXERCISE LAB:
 Dipyridamole was infused intravenously for 4 minutes at a dose of 0.142
 mg/kg/min. Two minutes after the cessation of infusion, Tc-[**Age over 90 26**]m sestamibi was
 administered IV.

 INTERPRETATION:
 Image Protocol: Gated SPECT.
 Resting perfusion images were obtained with thallium-201.
 Tracer was injected 15 minutes prior to obtaining the resting images.

 Stress images show moderate left ventricular enlargement which does not change
 during resting perfusion images.

 Stress images show a moderate perfusion defect in the anterior wall which is
 unchanged in resting perfusion images.  Stress images show a moderate perfusion
 defect in the inferior wall which does not change in the resting perfusion
 images.  Stress images show a mild perfusion defect in the septum which is also
 unchanged on the resting perfusion images.

 Ejection fraction calculated from gated wall motion images obtained after
 Dipyridamole administration is 19%.  There is global hypokinesis.

 Compared to prior study from [**2183-2-4**], the partial reversibility on the moderate
 perfusion defect of the anterior wall in no longer seen.

 IMPRESSION:  1) Moderate, fixed left ventricular enlargement.  2) Moderate,
 fixed perfusion defects in the anterior and inferior walls, mild, fixed
 perfusion defect in the septal wall.  Decreased EF of 19%.

 INDICATION:  75-year-old male with coronary disease status post CABG admitted
 with orchitis.

 COMPARISONS:  No comparisons are available.

 TECHNIQUE:  8 - MDCT axial images of the abdomen and pelvis were obtained
 without IV contrast.  IV contrast was not administered because the patient's
 creatinine was 2.6.  Oral contrast was not administered.

 CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is cardiomegaly and severe
 coronary artery calcifications.  There are no pleural effusions.  There are no
 pericardial effusions.  There are patchy opacities in bilateral lung bases
 which could represent atelectasis.

 There is a hypodense area in the dome of the liver measuring 10 mm (series 2,
 image 8).  This was not well characterized in the study.  There was another
 hyperdense area on lobe of the liver (series 2, image 24) measuring 4 mm. This
 was also too small to characterize.  The gallbladder is not distended. The
 spleen is unremarkable.

 Both adrenal glands are enlarged and slightly nodular.  Differential diagnosis
 would include adenomas versus hyperplasia.  There is no evidence of
 hydronephrosis.  There are calcifications of renal artery branches.  There is
 a small hypodense area in the mid pole of the right kidney measuring 6 mm that
 is too small to characterize in this study.  Hyperdense exophytic area of the
 lower pole of the left kidney was not well characterized in this study.
 Although it could represent a hyperdense cyst, possibility of a small mass
 cannot be excluded.  Recommend ultrasound of the kidney or MRI for further
 evaluation.

 The pancreas is unremarkable.  There is no intra or extrahepatic bile duct
 dilatation.  There is no pancreatic duct dilatation.  The small and large
 bowels are within normal limits.  The aorta is severely calcified.  There is
                                                             (Over)

 dilatation of the right common iliac artery, which measures up to 2 cm.  There
 is also aneurysmal dilatation of the right common femoral artery, which
 measures up to 2 cm. There is no free fluid or free air in the abdomen.

 CT OF THE PELVIS WITHOUT IV CONTRAST:  There is a Foley catheter within the
 urinary bladder.  The scrotum is markedly enlarged and there is a large amount
 of air within the scrotum with tracks up to the left inguinal canal.  The air
 in the scrotal sac predominates in the left side.  There is also stranding and
 edema.  These findings are consistent with a Fournier gangrene.  Findings were
 immediately communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59535**].

 BONE WINDOWS:  There are no suspicious lytic or blastic lesions.

 Multiplanar reconstructions, were important to evaluate the extent of the air.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Findings consistent with Fournier gangrene involving predominantly the
 left aspect of the scrotum.  It tracks up through the left inguinal canal.
 Findings were immediately communicated to Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 59535**] at 10:20 p.m.
 2.  Ectasia of the right common iliac artery measuring up to 2 cm.
 3.  Right femoral artery aneurysm measuring 2 cm.
 4.  Severe coronary artery calcifications and cardiomegaly.
 5.  Small hypodense areas in the liver and kidneys are not well characterized
 in this noncontrast study.
 6.  Exophytic hyperdense area in the lower pole of left kidney requires
 further workup with ultrasound or MRI.

 HISTORY:  AS, MR and new chest pain.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to chest radiographs since [**8-10**], most recently
 [**8-11**] at 8:05 a.m.

 Endotracheal tube, new left subclavian line and new right subclavian Swan-Ganz
 line are in standard placements.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural
 effusion.  Moderate cardiomegaly is stable.  There is no new mediastinal
 widening.

 A new subpleural opacity in the right mid lung marginated by the minor fissure
 and a triangular opacity at the base of the left lung projecting over the
 cardiac silhouette are concerning for pulmonary infarctions.  Pulmonary
 vascular engorgement has progressed slightly but there is no pulmonary edema
 or appreciable pleural effusion.

 HISTORY:  Aortic stenosis, mitral regurg and new onset chest pain.  Tachypnea.

 IMPRESSION:  AP chest compared to [**8-10**]:

 Moderate cardiomegaly is stable, including left atrial enlargement. Borderline
 edema, only in the right lower lobe, is new.  Left subclavian line projects
 over the expected course to the SVC. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
 Fullness in the mediastinum to the right of the trachea at the thoracic inlet
 is probably due to enlargement of the right lobe of the thyroid gland.
 Followup advised.

 INDICATION:  75-year-old man status post scrotal debridement, now with chest
 pain, evaluate infiltrate.

 COMPARISON:  Chest x-ray dated [**2166-8-11**].

 AP PORTABLE SUPINE, SINGLE VIEW:  The ET tube is in appropriate position at
 the thoracic inlet.  The feeding tube is coiled in the stomach with its tip in
 the fundus.  The left subclavian venous line has its tip at the junction of
 the left innominate vein with the superior vena cava.  The Swan-Ganz catheter
 has been slightly advanced, with its tip now terminating in the right
 interlobar pulmonary artery.  There is cardiomegaly, which is unchanged since
 the prior exam.  Again seen are median sternotomy wires.  The aortic knob is
 calcified.  In the lungs, there is progressive perihilar haziness, with
 associated peribronchial cuffing.  This is consistent with a slight
 progression of pulmonary edema.  Additionally, there is a linear retrocardiac
 opacity, which likely represents atelectasis in the left lower lobe.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  Perihilar haziness and peribronchial cuffing, suggestive of progressing
 pulmonary edema.
 2.  Retrocardiac linear opacity, which likely represents atelectasis in the
 left lower lobe.

 HISTORY:  Central line placement.

 FINDINGS:  The Swan-Ganz catheter has been removed.  There are bilateral
 subclavian lines with tip in the superior vena cava.  The heart continues to
 be moderately enlarged with increased retrocardiac opacity consistent with
 volume loss/infiltrate.  Mediastinal drains have been removed.  The NG tube
 tip is coiled in the stomach.  The ET tube is 5.5 cm above the carina.  The
 study is slightly limited by motion.  There is a probable small right effusion
 and some mild pulmonary vascular redistribution suggesting fluid overload.

 PORTABLE CHEST OF [**2166-8-18**]

 INDICATION:  Dobbhoff tube placement evaluation.

 Comparison is made to previous study of [**2166-8-17**].

 A feeding tube has been placed in the interval, terminating in the fundus of
 the stomach.  A nasogastric tube also terminates in this region.  Endotracheal
 tube and right subclavian vascular catheter are unchanged in position.  There
 is stable cardiomegaly, vascular engorgement, and perihilar haziness.
 Layering right pleural effusion is also without interval change.

 IMPRESSION:  New feeding tube terminating within the fundus of the stomach.
 Otherwise, no significant change since recent chest radiograph.

 MULTIDETECTOR CT SCAN OF THE ABDOMEN AND PELVIS WITH ORAL AND INTRAVENOUS
 CONTRAST (CT ENTEROGRAPHY PROTOCOL).

 Multiplanar reconstructions in the sagittal and coronal plane are also
 included.

 CLINICAL DETAILS:  Recent PEG tube placement.  Abdominal pain, evaluate for
 abscess.

 CT SCAN OF ABDOMEN WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST:  The heart size is enlarged,
 three-vessel coronary artery calcification is noted.  Patient has had a
 previous sternotomy.

 Minimal rim of fluid at both lung bases.  Minor patchy consolidation at the
 posterior aspect of the left lower lobe.Some consolidation in the dependent
 portion of the right lower lobe.

 A  5 to 6mm uncalcified nodule in the anterolateral aspect of the left lower
 lobe (series 2, image 9) could represent an uncalcified granuloma.  If there
 is no background concerning clinical history, interval followup in a year
 could be considered to ensure stability.

 Nasogastric tube tip lies in the gastric fundus.

 The percutaneous gastrostomy tube lies in the gastric body.  There is no
 adjacent or other intraabdominal collection, free fluid, or air.

 The liver is normal in size.  There is a subcentimeter fluid-attenuating cyst
 in the dome of segment 8 of the liver (series 2, image 11) and a nonspecific 5
 mm area of nodular hyperattenuation more laterally at the dome (series 2,

 image 12).  The spleen, gallbladder, pancreas are normal.  The adrenal glands
 are slightly prominent in size but no lesions demonstrated.

 Both kidneys are normal in size.  Small number of subcentimeter well rounded
 cortical hypodensities are too small to characterize.  6-mm exophytic
 posterior to the left lower pole cortex was hyperdense in the preceding non-
 contrast CT.  It does not show post-contrast enhancement and most probably
 represents a hyperdense cyst, this could be followed up with interval
 ultrasound in 6 months to further characterize/ensure stability.

 Generalized atheromatous calcification of the abdominal aorta and iliac
 vasculature, the abdominal aorta is normal in caliber.

 CT SCAN OF PELVIS WITH ORAL AND IV CONTRAST:  Moderate diverticulosis of the
 lower left and upper sigmoid colon.

 The prostate gland is normal in size, urinary catheter within the bladder,
 which is empty at time of scanning.

 Focal ectasia of the distal right common femoral artery measuring up to 2.4 cm
 AP x 2.3 cm transverse with generalized atherosclerotic calcification.  The
 inferiormost images show the superior extent of recent skin incision in medial
 left groin.

 No concerning bone lesions demonstrated on bone window settings.  There is at
 least a 25% collapse of the superior endplate of the T8 vertebral body.  The
 remainder of the vertebral body heights in the lower thoracic and lumber spine
 are intact.

 Probable incidental hemangioma noted in the T10 vertebral body.

 CONCLUSION:

 1.  No intraabdominal or pelvic abscess or free fluid demonstrated.  The PEG
 tube lies in the gastric body.

 2.  Patchy consolidation in the dependent portions of both lower lobes more
 marked on the right side.

 3.  5 to 6mm uncalcified nodule in the inferolateral aspect of the left lower
 lobe as described.  If there is no concerning background clinical history then
 interval followup in one year as advised to ensure stability.

Attending:[**First Name3 (LF) 6157**]
Chief Complaint:
epididymitis

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
incision and drainage of Fournier's gangrene

History of Present Illness:
The patient is a 75 year old male who was transferred from an
outside hospital because of a suspected myocardial infarction on
[**2166-8-10**] and possible need for cardiac catheterization.  He was
admitted to the cardiology service initially.  His symproms
actually began six days prior to admission with flu-like
symptoms.  Then five days prior to admission, the patient began
complaining of a painful lump in his left testicle.  His
symptoms gradually worsened, with increasing pain, erythema, and
edema of his left testicle.  In addition, he complained of
difficulty urinating for two days prior to admission.  He was
admitted to an outside hospital four days prior to admission
here, at which time a Foley catheter was placed and he was
started on IV Levofloxacin and Clindamycin (which was switched
to Levofloxacin and Vancomycin the following day) for
epididymitis diagnosed by ultrasound.  The ultrasound also
showed questionable air in the scrotum.  The patient was seen by
a urologist, Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], as well as an infectious disease
specialist.  He denied any trauma to his scrotum.  He has no
significant urologic history.  His prostate examination revealed
a 20 to 25 gram nonfluctuent prostate.  He is not diabetic and
he is not immunocompromised.  He reported that his pain has been
improving on the antibiotics.  However, on the night prior to
admission he developed acute pulmonary edema, shortness of
breath, hypotension and EKG changes suggestive of myocardial
infarction (ST elevation in leads V1-[**Street Address(2) 23394**] depression in
V5-6).  His peak troponin was 0.96.  Neo-synepherine was started
upon admission because of hypotension, which was presumed to be
secondary to sepsis.  Significant cardiac history includes a
CABG in [**2141**], hypertension, aortic stenosis, mitral
regurgitation, high cholesterol, and congestive heart failure
(EF of 40%).  Upon re-evaluation at this hospital, his EKG
changes were thought to be secondary to demand ischemia, rather
than a myocardial infarction.  In addition, the patient was
noted to be in acute renal failure, with a createnine of 1.8 on
admission, likely due to prerenal causes.  Blood and urine
cultures from the outside hospital were all negative.

Past Medical History:
As above.  Left femoral to popliteal bypass graft

Social History:
none significant

none

Physical Exam:
General: no apparent distress

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient was admitted to the cardiology service at [**Hospital1 18**] on
[**2166-8-10**] for presumed myocardial infarction on electrocardiogram,
which was later attributed to demand ischemia due to sepsis.  He
was initially started on neo-synephrine for hypotension.  He was
continued on Vancomycin and Levofloxacin for his epididymitis.
The urology team saw and evaluated the patient as a consult
service under Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4229**].  Our suspicion of Fournier's gangrene
at that time was very low, considering his lack of risk factors
and lack of significant groin erythema, however a CT scan of his
abdomen and pelvis was ordered to rule out Fournier's.  That CT
scan confirmed the diagnosis of Fournier's gangrene on the
morning of hospital day two (tracking of air around his left
hemi scrotum tracking up the left spermatic cord.  At that time,
the patient was emergently rushed to the operating room for
emergent surgical debridement by Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4229**] and Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **], chief
urology resident.  During the operation, the patient had the
majority of his left scrotum and all of his left testicle
removed.  He was then admitted to the trauma intensive care
unit.  He was sedated on Propofol with Fentanyl for pain.  He
was started on a Levophed drip to maintain blood pressure.  A
central venous line was placed, as well as a Swann Ganz
catheter.  An oro-gastric tube was placed and put to gravity.
His Foley was continued from the operating room.  Dressing
changes to his scrotum were scheduled for three times per day.
On postoperative day two, his maximum temperature was 101.0.
His Levophed drip was weaned to a low level. Tube feeds were
started through his NG tube.  On postoperative day three, the
plastic surgery service began their evaluation of the patient
for future closure of his wound.  His propofol was discontinued.
 His Levophed was discontinued.  He vomited twice and his tube
feeds were held for high residuals.  He recieved one unit of red
blood cells for a hematocrit under 30, and his hematocrit
responded well.  His acute renal appeared to have resolved, as
his createnine dropped down to 1.0.  On postoperative day four,
his ventillator was weaned to pressure support, however he had
some apneic spells.  A HIT panel was negative and his
subcutaneous heparin was restarted.  He had some bedside
debridement by the urology team and his wound looked like it was
healing well.  He was transfused with another unit of red blood
cells.  The patient was noted to be roughly twenty liters
positive and diuresis with a Lasix drip was started as
tolerated.  On postoperative day seven, the patient required
some propofol for sedation due to endotracheal tube and
oro-gastric tube irritation.  A sputum culture came back
positive for MRSA sensative to Vancomycin.  His wound cultures
were positive for mixed flora including Bacteroides, Provatella,
and coagulase negative Staphylococcus.  A wound VAC was placed
by urology.  On postoperative day eight, a post-pyloric feeding
tube was placed by interventional radiology because the patient
was not tolerating tube feeds via the oro-gastric tube.  On
postoperative day nine, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 4229**] agreed to allow placement of a
tracheostomy tube and a PEG tube at a later date.  The patient
had been unable to tolerate a ventillator wean up to this point,
most likely due to his fluid overload and his cardiac history.
Tube feeds were running at agoal of 90ml/ hour.  On
postoperative day ten, his Flagyl and Levofloxacin were
discontinued.  He was transfused one unit of blood for a
hematocrit less than thirty.  On postoperative day twelve, he
recieved another unit of red blood cells.

On POD 14, a #8 percutaneous trach was placed at the bedside.  A
perc PEG was placed uner direct visualization, but the tube was
pulled through the abdominal wall.  The patient was subsequently
taken to the OR for an open gastrostomy tube which was placed
without further complication.  Vancomycin was stopped on [**8-25**]
after a complete 14-day course.  On [**2166-8-27**], the wound was
closed primarily at the bedside by the plastic surgery service.
TF were restarted on [**2166-8-27**] and advanced as tolerated.  A PICC
line was also placed on [**2166-8-27**].  Propofol was d/c'd on [**2166-8-28**].
 ON [**2166-8-28**], the patient spiked a temp to 102.  Cultures were
drawn and the A-line tip sent for culture as well.  [**2166-8-29**] tube
feeds were held for high residuals, an ileus was found on
imaginig.  PT evaluation occured on [**2166-8-29**].  Trach mask trials
were started on [**2166-8-28**] and the vent weaned as tolerated, with
the patient still requring vent assistance most of the day.
Vancomycin was restarted on [**2166-8-30**] for MRSA sputum; it will be
continued for 7 days; the JP drain was removed on this day as
well.  TF were restarted on [**2166-9-1**] and brought to goal over the
next day.  The patient is now tolerating TF at goal with bowel
movements.

On [**2166-9-3**], the patient was tolerating TF at goal, having bowel
movements, tolerating trach mask trials daily, was working with
PT, had good pain control with roxicet elixer, was alert and
requring no sedation.  He was subsequently transfered to rehab
for physical therapy and vent weaning.

Antepartum/intrapartum Hx - [**Last Name (un) 49**] [**2115-1-3**] for EGA 35 weeks. Ultrasound 18 weeks and 25 weeks, showing placenta previa. Pregnancy subsequently complicated by preterm labor from 28 weeks gestation, managed with bed rest since that time, with intermittent vaginal hemorrhage. Did not receive antenatal corticosteroids. Today increasing preterm labor leading to spontaneous vaginal delvery under epidural anesthesia. ROM 1 hour delivery. No fetal tachycardia or maternal fever. Received intrapartum antibiotics 5 hours prior to delivery. Infant emerged with weak cry and well maintained heart rate. Oral and nasal bulb sucitoning, tactile stim provided and dried. Subsequently brief positive pressure ventilation for irregular respiratory effort. Spontaneous regular respirations established, but infant still pale with intermittent grunting, and was therefore transferred to NICU. Apgars 6 at one minute, 8 at five minutes. Examination of placenta showed scattered old clots without calcifications.

35 week AGA newborn female from pregnancy complicated by preterm labor and chronic placental abruption, with
1. Respiratory distress - likely surfactant deficiency, but consider retained fetal lung fluid, infection
2. Sepsis risk - based on preterm labor, GBS positive status, but attenuated by intrapartum antibiotic therapy > 4 hours prior to delivery

and consider intubation for increased respiratory distress, FiO2 requirement >35% or respiratory acidosis. Subsequently monitor for maturity of respiratory control.

CVS - One bolus of normal saline given for pallor initially, but currently hemodynamically stable. Maintain mean bp > 40 mmHg and follow cardiac clinical examination.

FEN - NPO until respiratory stability established. Initial d-stick 48 prior to start of IV dextrose. Continue to follow glucose, weight, urine output. Start TFI 80 cc/kg/day and check serum electrolytes at 24 hours.

ID - Moderate risk of infection on basis of GBS and preterm labor, although the placental abruption is the more likely explanation for preterm labor. In light of respiratory symptoms, however, we will obtain CBC and blood culture and start broad spectrum antibiotic therapy, for anticipated course of 48 hours pending results and WBC and culture, and resolution of symptoms.

CNS - Neurologically appropriate currently. Mother was regularly taking codeine (q3h) for a week prior to delivery for rib discomfort secondary to a cough. The infant should be monitored for signs of abstinence, although the risk of this is relatively low.

Heme - Infant appears persistently moderately pale. No acute intrapartum blood loss noted, but more chronic blood loss secondary to abruption, in addition to nuchal cord, might have resulted in anemia. Hematocrit is pending.

Soc - Father is a pediatric intensivist and infectious disease specialist at [**Hospital3 50**]. Parents updated at bedside.

 INDICATION:  History of brainstem lesion on outside MR.

 COMPARISON:  Outside MR not available for comparison.

 TECHNIQUE:  Post-contrast multiplanar T1 MR imaging including a multiplanar
 RAGE imaging was performed.

 FINDINGS:  No focal enhancing lesions are demonstrated.  However, the pons is
 uniformly enlarged, with mass effect causing compression of the fourth
 ventricle. Otherwise, the study is unremarkable, without abnormal signal
 demonstrated in the brain parenchyma. The ventricles are normal in size
 without evidence for hydrocephalus.  There is no evidence for brainstem
 herniation.

 IMPRESSION:  Expandedpons with mass effect upon the fourth ventricle.  No
 focal enhancing lesion is identified.  Findings are concerning for low-grade
 pontine glioma, admittedly an unusual diagnosis in an adult patient.

 Evaluate for bleed.

 TECHNIQUE:  Non-contrast head CT.

 FINDINGS:  Again, there is an enlarged pons noted.  There is a tiny bubble of
 gas within the right side of the pons, presumably at the post-biopsy site.
 There is right-sided pneumocephaly.  Small amount of air is noted within the
 frontal [**Doctor Last Name 218**] of the right lateral ventricle.  There is no evidence of an
 intracranial hemorrhage.  There is no shift of the normally midline
 structures.  The [**Doctor Last Name 37**]-white matter differentiation seems grossly preserved,
 with no evidence of acute infarct.  The pons is noted to be enlarged as before
 causing mass effect upon the fourth ventricle.  There is no hydrocephalus.

 IMPRESSION:  Status post biopsy with no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.
 Pneumocephaly and gas is at presumed biopsy site within the right side of the
 pons.

 INDICATION:  History of colon cancer and testicular cancer, with pons glioma,
 which significant hilar lymphadenopathy.  Evaluate pulmonary pathology
 further, which was seen on prior chest x-ray.

 COMPARISON:  None.

 TECHNIQUE:  Contiguous axial images were obtained from the thoracic inlet to
 the lung bases.

 CONTRAST:  100 cc of IV Optiray contrast were administered due to the rapid
 rate of bolus injection required for this study.

 CT OF THE CHEST WITH IV CONTRAST:  There are several small mediastinal lymph
 nodes in the right paratracheal and precarinal position which are not enlarged
 by CT criteria.  There is a small right perihilar lymph node also noted.  No
 axillary lymphadenopathy is seen.  The heart and pericardium are normal in
 appearance.  The great vessels are normal in appearance.  The patient is
 intubated, and an ET tube is seen within the superior portion of the trachea.
 A tiny hypodensity is seen within the left lobe of the thyroid gland.

 Within the left lower lobe, there is a consolidative opacity, with central
 area of necrosis, an air-fluid level, and low-attenuation material.
 Additionally, there are several areas within the right and left lungs
 peripherally, with patchy opacity and tree-in-[**Male First Name (un) 2085**] opacities, concerning for
 multifocal opacity.  There is also a wedge-shaped opacity in the right lower
 lung zone, some of which may represent atelectasis.

 There is a 3.3 x 2.6 cm nodule with multiple foci of calcification within
 the left lower lobe.

 Within limited images of the superior portions of the liver, spleen, kidneys,
 adrenal glands, stomach, and pancreas, no definite abnormalities are
 identified.

 IMPRESSION:
 1.  There is opacity at the left lung base, which is wedge shaped, and
 contains an area of fluid and air suggesting necrotizing pneumonia.
 Additionally, there are multifocal peripheral opacities bilaterally, which

 2.  There is a 3.3 x 2.6 cm nodule within the left lower lobe, which

 calcification of a benign lesion such as a hamartoma; however, in the setting
 of colon cancer, a metastatic focus from a primary colonic malignancy cannot
 be entirely excluded.
